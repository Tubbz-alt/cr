 ## Interacting with the agent
-At runtime the agent can be used to modify the transformed state of a class. To specify a desired state, supply the setTransforms function with a XML description of transformations to keep or modify, and leave out all those that should be reverted to their preinstrumentation versions.

 ## Known Issues
 * The full converter support is still to be merged into the open source repo
 * Support for emitting an event only on exception has yet to be implemented
 * Support for reflective access to fields has yet to be implemented

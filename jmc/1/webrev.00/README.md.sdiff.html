302 ## Using the Built JMC Update Site in Eclipse
303 As part of the JMC build, the JMC update sites will be built. 
304 
305 There is one update site for the stand-alone RCP application, providing plug-ins for the stand-alone release of JMC:
306 
307 ```bash
308 application/org.openjdk.jmc.updatesite.rcp/target/
309 ```
310 
311 There is another update site for the Eclipse plug-ins, providing plug-ins for running JMC inside of Eclipse:
312 
313 ```bash
314 application/org.openjdk.jmc.updatesite.ide/target/
315 ```
316 
317 To install it into Eclipe, simply open Eclipse and select Help | Install New Software... In the dialog, click Add... and then click the Archive... button. Select the built update site, e.g. 
318 
319 ```bash
<span class="line-modified">320 application/org.openjdk.jmc.updatesite.ide/target/org.openjdk.jmc.updatesite.ide-7.1.0-SNAPSHOT.zip</span>
321 ```
322 
323 ## Setting Up for Development and Launching in Eclipse
324 First make sure that you have a recent version of Eclipse. An Eclipse 2018-09 with the JDK 11 plug-in installed (available from Eclipse Marketplace) will do. You may also want to install the Mercurial Plug-in for Eclipse (MercurialEclipse). The Eclipse Marketplace is available under **Help | Eclipse Marketplace...**.
325 
326 To set Eclipse up for JMC development, do the following:
327 
328 1. First ensure that you have started the jetty server in the first step of building JMC.
329 2. Next open (File | Open...) the Eclipse target platform of interest, for example releng/platform-definitions/platform-definition-photon/platform.target
330 3. In the upper right corner of the platform editor that opens, click the link &quot;Set as Active Target Platform&quot;
331 4. Import the projects you are interested in (core and/or application) into a recent Eclipse.
332 5. If importing the application projects, make sure you create a user library (Preferences | Java/Build Path/User Libraries) named JMC_JDK, and add (Add External JARs...) the following JARs from a JDK 8 (u40 or above) to the User Library:
333  - tools.jar (&lt;JDK&gt;/lib/tools.jar)
334  - jconsole.jar (&lt;JDK&gt;/lib/jconsole.jar)
335  - jfxswt.jar (&lt;JDK&gt;/jre/lib/jfxswt.jar)
336  - jfxrt.jar (&lt;JDK&gt;/jre/lib/ext/jfxrt.jar)
337 
338 Note that importing configuration/ide/eclipse as an Eclipse project should automatically make the development launchers available to you.

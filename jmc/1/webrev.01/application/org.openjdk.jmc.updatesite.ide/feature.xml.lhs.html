40       This is a release engineering internal &amp;quot;feature&amp;quot;. It just happen
41 to use the same file format as end user visible features. Its
42 sole purpose is to list the features that will be exported into
43 a p2 repository (a.k.a. update site), and provide a default name
44 for it (rarely seen). No other aspects of it will ever reach
45 end users. String externalization is NOT supported. Do NOT insert
46 copyright or other irrelevant stuff in here.

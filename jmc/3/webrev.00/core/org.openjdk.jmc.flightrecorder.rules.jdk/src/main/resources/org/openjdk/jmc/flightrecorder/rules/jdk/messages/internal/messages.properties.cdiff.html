<span class="line-modified">! SystemGcRuleFactory_TEXT_INFO_LONG=Calling System.gc() might not be optimal, since it can cause an unnecessary amount of garbage collections. The garbage collectors usually handles this fine by themselves without being explicitly called.&lt;p&gt;To fix this, remove unnecessary System.gc() calls in the code. If the calls are made by libraries where you can&#39;t change the source code, you can instead use the command line flag &#39;-XX:+DisableExplicitGC&#39;. This flag makes the JVM ignore all System.gc() calls.</span>

This may be acceptable if the individual allocations are intended to be larger than a reasonable TLAB. It may be possible to avoid this by decreasing the size of the individual allocations. There are some TLAB related JVM flags that you can experiment with, but it is usually better to let the JVM manage TLAB sizes automatically.

It was initiated from thread &#39;&#39;{2}&#39;&#39; and happened at {3}. &lt;p&gt;VM operations are JVM internal operations. Some VM operations are executed synchronously (i.e. will block the calling thread), and some need to be executed at so called safe points. Safe point polling is a cooperative suspension mechanism that halts byte code execution in the JVM. A VM operation occurring at a safe point will effectively be &quot;stopping the world&quot;, meaning that no Java code will be executing in any thread while executing VM operations at that safe point. Long lasting VM operations executing at safe points can decrease the responsiveness of an application. &lt;p&gt;If you do find such VM operations, then the type of operation and its caller thread provide vital information to understand why the VM operation happened. To find more details, check if there is an event in the caller thread intersecting this event time wise. Looking at the stack trace for such an event can help determining what caused it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&quot;http://openjdk.java.net/groups/hotspot/docs/RuntimeOverview.html&quot;&gt;Runtime Overview&lt;/a&gt; for further information.&lt;/p&gt;

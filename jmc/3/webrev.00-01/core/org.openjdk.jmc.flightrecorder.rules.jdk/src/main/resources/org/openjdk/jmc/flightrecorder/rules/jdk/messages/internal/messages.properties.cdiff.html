  AllocationRuleFactory_TEXT_CLASS_INFO_LONG=Frequently allocated types are good places to start when trying to reduce garbage collections. Look at where the most common types are being allocated to see if many instances are created along the same call path. Try to reduce the number of instances created by invoking the most commonly taken paths less.
  AllocationRuleFactory_TEXT_THREAD_INFO_LONG=Many allocations performed by the same thread might indicate a problem in a multi-threaded program. Look at the stack traces for the thread with the highest allocation rate. See if the allocation rate can be brought down, or balanced among the active threads.

  CodeCacheRuleFactory_SIZE_WARN_LIMIT_DESC=If the occupancy exceeds this limit then the rule will return a Warning result
  CodeCacheRuleFactory_TEXT_OK=No problems with the code cache were detected in the recording.
  CodeCacheRuleFactory_TEXT_WARN=The code cache was filled during this recording.
  CodeCacheRuleFactory_TEXT_WARN_LONG=This can happen if you have a lot of code in your application or if the code cache is too small. If the code cache is filled, the JVM will stop compiling new methods which means that your code will run slower than necessary. Increase the size of the code cache with &#39;-XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize&#39;, for example &#39;-XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize=128M&#39;.
  CodeCacheRuleFactory_WARN_LONG_DESCRIPTION=This causes the code cache to be swept more frequently, with even higher occupancy causing more frequent sweeps.
<span class="line-modified">! CodeCacheRuleFactory_WARN_SEGMENTED_HEAP_SHORT_DESCRIPTION=The {0} code heap reached more than 50% occupancy during the recording.</span>

  CompareCpuRule_RULE_NAME=Competing CPU Ratio Usage
  CompareCpuRule_TEXT_INFO_LONG=The application performance can be affected when the machine is under heavy load and there are other processes that use CPU or other resources on the same computer. To profile representatively or get higher throughput, shut down other resource intensive processes running on the machine.
  CompareCpuRule_TEXT_TOO_FEW_SAMPLES=Not enough samples available to calculate result.
  # {0} is a time period, {1} is a time stamp, {2} is a percentage

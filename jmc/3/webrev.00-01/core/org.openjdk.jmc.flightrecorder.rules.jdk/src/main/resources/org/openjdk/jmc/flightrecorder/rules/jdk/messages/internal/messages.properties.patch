 AllocationRuleFactory_TEXT_CLASS_INFO_LONG=Frequently allocated types are good places to start when trying to reduce garbage collections. Look at where the most common types are being allocated to see if many instances are created along the same call path. Try to reduce the number of instances created by invoking the most commonly taken paths less.
 AllocationRuleFactory_TEXT_THREAD_INFO_LONG=Many allocations performed by the same thread might indicate a problem in a multi-threaded program. Look at the stack traces for the thread with the highest allocation rate. See if the allocation rate can be brought down, or balanced among the active threads.

  TlabAllocationRatioRuleFactory_RULE_NAME=TLAB Allocation Ratio
  # {0} is a percentage
  TlabAllocationRatioRuleFactory_TEXT_INFO=The program allocated {0} of the memory outside of TLABs.
  TlabAllocationRatioRuleFactory_TEXT_RECOMMEND_LESS_ALLOCATION=Allocating objects outside of Thread Local Allocation Buffers (TLABs) is more expensive than allocating inside TLABs. This may be acceptable if the individual allocations are intended to be larger than a reasonable TLAB. It may be possible to avoid this by decreasing the size of the individual allocations. There are some TLAB related JVM flags that you can experiment with, but it is usually better to let the JVM manage TLAB sizes automatically.

585 StringDeduplicationRule_RESULT_USE_STRING_DEDUPLICATION_ENABLED=String deduplication is already enabled.
586 StringDeduplicationRule_RESULT_NON_G1_LONG=String deduplication is only supported when using the G1 garbage collector. If you want to use this feature you can enable G1 by using &#39;-XX:+UseG1GC&#39;.
587 StringDeduplicationRule_RESULT_PRE_8_20=String deduplication is only available in JDK 8u20 or later. If you want to use this feature you need to run with a newer JDK version.
588 StringDeduplicationRule_RESULT_DONT_RECOMMEND_STRING_DEDUPLICATION=There is likely no big benefit from enabling string deduplication.
589 StringDeduplicationRule_RESULT_RECOMMEND_STRING_DEDUPLICATION=Your application might benefit from enabling string deduplication.
590 # {0} is an event type, # {1} is an event type
591 StringDeduplicationRule_RESULT_NO_MAX_HEAP_INFO=No information available about the maximum heap size, enable event type {0} or {1} to improve the accuracy of this rule.
592 StringDeduplicationRule_RESULT_NO_ALLOC_ITEMS=Found no allocation events for the internal arrays in strings. Either the frame filter preference is incorrectly defined, or the stackTrace attribute is not enabled for the allocation events.
593 # {0} is a percentage
594 StringDeduplicationRule_RESULT_HEAP_USAGE=The heap is around {0} % full.
595 # {0} is a percentage, {1} is either &#39;byte[]&#39; or &#39;char[]&#39;
596 StringDeduplicationRule_RESULT_STRING_ARRAY_LIVESET_RATIO=Approximately {0} % of the live set consists of the internal array type of strings (&#39;&#39;{1}&#39;&#39; for this JDK version).
597 # {0} is a percentage, {1} is either &#39;byte[]&#39; or &#39;char[]&#39;
598 StringDeduplicationRule_RESULT_STRING_ARRAY_ALLOCATION_RATIO=Approximately {0} % of all allocations were of internal arrays in strings ({1} for this JDK version).
599 StringDeduplicationRule_RESULT_LONG_DESCRIPTION=String deduplication is enabled using the JVM flag &#39;-XX:+UseStringDeduplication&#39;. This flag can be used together with the G1 garbage collector in JDK 8u20 or later.&lt;p&gt;To validate if this gives a performance improvement for your application, create flight recordings both with and without string deduplication. For the run with string deduplication enabled, also enable statistics with &#39;-XX:+PrintStringDeduplicationStatistics&#39; for JDK 8 or &#39;-Xlog:stringdedup*=debug&#39; for JDK 9. Check if the heap live set decrease in the recording with string deduplication enabled is larger than the size of the string deduplication metadata table. The size of the metadata table is printed in the statistics output as &#39;Table/Memory Usage: XX MB&#39;&lt;p&gt;You can read more about string deduplication in the java options documentation or in &lt;a href=&quot;http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/192&quot;&gt;JEP 192&lt;/a&gt;.
600 SystemGcRule_CONFIG_WARNING_LIMIT=System.gc() ratio limit
601 SystemGcRule_CONFIG_WARNING_LIMIT_LONG=Warning limit for ratio between System.gc() and total garbage collections
602 SystemGcRuleFactory_RULE_NAME=GCs Caused by System.gc()
603 # {0} is a percentage
604 SystemGcRuleFactory_TEXT_INFO={0} of the garbage collections were caused by System.gc().
<span class="line-modified">605 SystemGcRuleFactory_TEXT_INFO_LONG=Calling System.gc() can cause unnecessary garbage collections and isn&#39;t usually needed.&lt;p&gt;If the calls are in libraries where you can&#39;t change the source code, you can use the command line flag &#39;-XX:+DisableExplicitGC&#39; to make the JVM ignore all System.gc() calls.</span>
606 SystemGcRuleFactory_TEXT_OK=No garbage collections were caused by System.gc().
607 TlabAllocationRatioRuleFactory_RULE_NAME=TLAB Allocation Ratio
608 # {0} is a percentage
609 TlabAllocationRatioRuleFactory_TEXT_INFO=The program allocated {0} of the memory outside of TLABs.
610 TlabAllocationRatioRuleFactory_TEXT_RECOMMEND_LESS_ALLOCATION=Allocating objects outside of Thread Local Allocation Buffers (TLABs) is more expensive than allocating inside TLABs. This may be acceptable if the individual allocations are intended to be larger than a reasonable TLAB. It may be possible to avoid this by decreasing the size of the individual allocations. There are some TLAB related JVM flags that you can experiment with, but it is usually better to let the JVM manage TLAB sizes automatically.
611 TlabAllocationRatioRuleFactory_TEXT_INFO_ONLY_OUTSIDE=The program only allocated objects outside of TLABs.
612 TlabAllocationRatioRuleFactory_TEXT_INFO_ONLY_OUTSIDE_LONG=The program only allocated objects outside of Thread Local Allocation Buffers (TLABs).
613 TlabAllocationRatioRuleFactory_TEXT_OK_NO_OUTSIDE=No object allocations outside of TLABs detected.
614 UnlockExperimentalVMOptionsRuleFactory_TEXT_INFO=The recording was performed on a JVM that had Experimental VM Options enabled.
615 UnlockExperimentalVMOptionsRuleFactory_TEXT_INFO_LONG=Experimental VM options may be unreliable and should not be used in a production environment. Unless you have to use an experimental option, you should avoid the &#39;-XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions&#39; command line option.
616 VMOperations_RULE_NAME=VMOperation Peak Duration
617 VMOperationRule_CONFIG_WARNING_LIMIT=Blocking VM operation duration warning limit
618 VMOperationRule_CONFIG_WARNING_LIMIT_LONG=The minimum duration for a blocking VM operation needed to trigger a warning
619 # {0} is a time period
620 VMOperationRuleFactory_TEXT_OK=No excessively long VM operations were found in this recording (the longest was {0}).
621 # {0} is a time period
622 VMOperationRuleFactory_TEXT_WARN=There are long lasting blocking VM operations in this recording (the longest is {0}).
623 # {0} is a time period, {1} is a time stamp, {2} is a thread name, {3} is a time stamp
624 VMOperationRuleFactory_TEXT_WARN_LONG=There are long lasting blocking VM operations in this recording. The longest was of type {1} and lasted for {0}. It was initiated from thread &#39;&#39;{2}&#39;&#39; and happened at {3}. &lt;p&gt;VM operations are JVM internal operations. Some VM operations are executed synchronously (i.e. will block the calling thread), and some need to be executed at so called safe points. Safe point polling is a cooperative suspension mechanism that halts byte code execution in the JVM. A VM operation occurring at a safe point will effectively be &quot;stopping the world&quot;, meaning that no Java code will be executing in any thread while executing VM operations at that safe point. Long lasting VM operations executing at safe points can decrease the responsiveness of an application. &lt;p&gt;If you do find such VM operations, then the type of operation and its caller thread provide vital information to understand why the VM operation happened. To find more details, check if there is an event in the caller thread intersecting this event time wise. Looking at the stack trace for such an event can help determining what caused it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&quot;http://openjdk.java.net/groups/hotspot/docs/RuntimeOverview.html&quot;&gt;Runtime Overview&lt;/a&gt; for further information.&lt;/p&gt;

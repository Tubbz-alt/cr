34  * This package contains the core RJMX services.
35  * &lt;p&gt;
36  * The following example will print the help for all diagnostic commands:
37  *
38  * &lt;pre&gt;
39  * IConnectionDescriptor descriptor = new ConnectionDescriptorBuilder().hostName(&quot;localhost&quot;).port(0).build();
40  * IServerHandle server = IServerHandle.create(descriptor);
41  * try {
42  * 	IConnectionHandle connection = server.connect(&quot;Run Diagnostic commands&quot;);
43  * 	IDiagnosticCommandService dcmd = connection.getServiceOrDummy(IDiagnosticCommandService.class);
44  * 	for (IOperation operation : dcmd.getOperations()) {
45  * 		System.out.println(dcmd.runCtrlBreakHandlerWithResult(String.format(&quot;help %s&quot;, operation.getName())));
46  * 	}
47  * } finally {
48  * 	server.dispose();
49  * }
50  * &lt;/pre&gt;
51  *
52  * Services are normally added through the &lt;tt&gt;org.openjdk.jmc.rjmx.service&lt;/tt&gt; extension point.
53  * The extension point requires a factory which will be used to create your service. The factory
54  * must implement the {@link org.openjdk.jmc.rjmx.services.IServiceFactory} interface. The following
55  * example shows how the flight recorder service is added in the &lt;tt&gt;plugin.xml&lt;tt&gt; for the RJMX
56  * plug-in itself:
57  *
58  * &lt;pre&gt;
59 &amp;lt;extension point=&quot;org.openjdk.jmc.rjmx.service&quot;&amp;gt;
60 	&amp;lt;service
61 		factory=&quot;org.openjdk.jmc.rjmx.services.internal.FlightRecorderServiceFactory&quot;
62 		description=&quot;Service for controlling the flight recorder&quot;
63 		name=&quot;Flight Recorder&quot;&amp;gt;
64 	&amp;lt;/service&amp;gt;
65 &amp;lt;/extension&amp;gt;
66  * &lt;/pre&gt;
67  *
68  * Note that any plug-in can publish services in this manner.

  * This class handles heap dump objects that are given to it by the instance of HeapScaner (that is

  * chain from a GC root to the current object at all times. This class analyzes each scanned object
  * for various kinds of problems, and records problem type/overhead if anything found via the
- * supplied instance of {@link org.openjdk.jmc.joverflow.support.ProblemRecorder}. See the latter for
- * more information on problems and object kinds that they can occur on.

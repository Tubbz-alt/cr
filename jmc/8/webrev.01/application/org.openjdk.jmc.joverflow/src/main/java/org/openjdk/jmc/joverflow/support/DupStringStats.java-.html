 42  * &lt;p&gt;
 43  * In particular, getDupStrings() returns the list of duplicate strings sorted by overhead. The
 44  * overhead is defined as specified in {@link org.openjdk.jmc.joverflow.stats.StringStatsCollector}, but
 45  * in reality we perform a bit more crude estimate, since duplicate strings may reference sub-ranges
 46  * of backing char[] arrays, and we don&#39;t keep length of each backing char array. The estimate is
 47  * conservative, i.e. the returned overhead should not be greater than the real one. We also take
 48  * care of the fact that some shallowly duplicate Strings with different values may point to the
 49  * same backing arrays. For example, a pair of objects with values &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; both point to &#39;abc&#39;
 50  * array, and another pair &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; points to &#39;abd&#39;. In this case, the size of both &#39;abc&#39; and &#39;abd&#39;
 51  * will count towards overhead, but only once for each (i.e. 3 + 3 chars, not 3 + 3 + 3 + 3).

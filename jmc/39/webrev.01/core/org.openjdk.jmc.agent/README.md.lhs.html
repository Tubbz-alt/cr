<pre> 1 # The JMC Agent
 2 The JMC agent is an agent currently under development to add JFR instrumentation declaratively to a running program. The agent can, for example, be used to add flight recorder events to third party code for which the source is not available.
 3 
 4 To build the agent you will need a JDK 7 or later. To run the agent, a JDK 7 or later will be needed as well.
 5 
 6 ## Building the agent
 7 To build the agent, simply use maven in the agent folder. Since the agent is not ready for prime time yet, it is not built with the rest of the core libraries.
 8 
 9 ```bash
10 mvn clean package
11 ```
12 
13 ## Running the agent
14 The agent can be tried out using the included example program.
15 
16 Here is an example for running the example program with Oracle JDK 7 to Oracle JDK 10:
17 
18 ```bash
19 java -XX:+UnlockCommercialFeatures -XX:+FlightRecorder -javaagent:target/org.openjdk.jmc.agent-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar=target/test-classes/org/openjdk/jmc/agent/test/jfrprobes_template.xml -cp target/org.openjdk.jmc.agent-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:target/test-classes/ org.openjdk.jmc.agent.test.InstrumentMe
20 ```
21 
22 Here is an example for running the example program with OpenJDK 11+:
23 
24 ```bash
25 java --add-opens java.base/jdk.internal.misc=ALL-UNNAMED -XX:+FlightRecorder -javaagent:target/org.openjdk.jmc.agent-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar=target/test-classes/org/openjdk/jmc/agent/test/jfrprobes_template.xml -cp target/org.openjdk.jmc.agent-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:target/test-classes/ org.openjdk.jmc.agent.test.InstrumentMe
26 ```
27 
28 ## Interacting with the agent
29 At runtime the agent can be used to modify the transformed state of a class. To specify a desired state, supply the defineEventProbes function with a XML description of event probes to add, keep or modify, and leave out all those that should be reverted to their preinstrumentation versions.

31 ## Known Issues
32 * The full converter support is still to be merged into the open source repo
33 * Support for emitting an event only on exception has yet to be implemented
34 * Support for reflective access to fields has yet to be implemented
35 * Support for emitting event even though an exception was raised in a called method (try-finally)
36 * XML probe definition validation (schema)
37 * Support for redefinitions and controlling the agent over JMX is not yet completed

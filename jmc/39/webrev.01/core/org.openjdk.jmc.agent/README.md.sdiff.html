13 ## Running the agent
14 The agent can be tried out using the included example program.
15 
16 Here is an example for running the example program with Oracle JDK 7 to Oracle JDK 10:
17 
18 ```bash
19 java -XX:+UnlockCommercialFeatures -XX:+FlightRecorder -javaagent:target/org.openjdk.jmc.agent-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar=target/test-classes/org/openjdk/jmc/agent/test/jfrprobes_template.xml -cp target/org.openjdk.jmc.agent-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:target/test-classes/ org.openjdk.jmc.agent.test.InstrumentMe
20 ```
21 
22 Here is an example for running the example program with OpenJDK 11+:
23 
24 ```bash
25 java --add-opens java.base/jdk.internal.misc=ALL-UNNAMED -XX:+FlightRecorder -javaagent:target/org.openjdk.jmc.agent-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar=target/test-classes/org/openjdk/jmc/agent/test/jfrprobes_template.xml -cp target/org.openjdk.jmc.agent-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:target/test-classes/ org.openjdk.jmc.agent.test.InstrumentMe
26 ```
27 
28 ## Interacting with the agent
29 At runtime the agent can be used to modify the transformed state of a class. To specify a desired state, supply the defineEventProbes function with a XML description of event probes to add, keep or modify, and leave out all those that should be reverted to their preinstrumentation versions.
30 



31 ## Known Issues
32 * The full converter support is still to be merged into the open source repo
33 * Support for emitting an event only on exception has yet to be implemented
34 * Support for reflective access to fields has yet to be implemented
35 * Support for emitting event even though an exception was raised in a called method (try-finally)
36 * XML probe definition validation (schema)
37 * Support for redefinitions and controlling the agent over JMX is not yet completed

<span class="line-added">31 ### Using a security manager</span>
<span class="line-added">32 When running with a security manager, the &#39;control&#39; Management Permission must be granted to control the agent through the MBean. To set fine grained permissions for authenticated remote users, see [here](https://docs.oracle.com/javadb/10.10.1.2/adminguide/radminjmxenablepolicy.html#radminjmxenablepolicy) and [here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/management/agent.html#gdeup).</span>

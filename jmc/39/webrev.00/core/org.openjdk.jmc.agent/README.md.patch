 ## Interacting with the agent
 At runtime the agent can be used to modify the transformed state of a class. To specify a desired state, supply the defineEventProbes function with a XML description of event probes to add, keep or modify, and leave out all those that should be reverted to their preinstrumentation versions.
 
+### Using a security manager
+To make MBean calls more secure, the agent can be run with a security manager. A manager can be enabled by adding the VM option `-Djava.security.manager` and by supplying a policy file of permissions to grant as such: `-Djava.security.policy=permissions.policy`. The 'control' Management Permission must be granted in order for MBean function calls to succeed.

 ## Known Issues
 * The full converter support is still to be merged into the open source repo
 * Support for emitting an event only on exception has yet to be implemented
 * Support for reflective access to fields has yet to be implemented
 * Support for emitting event even though an exception was raised in a called method (try-finally)

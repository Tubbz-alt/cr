40  * This test is based on the test case reported in JDK-8209830
41  *
42  * Redundant CSS Re-application was avoided in JDK-8193445.
43  * It results in faster application of CSS on Controls (Nodes). In turn,
44  * resulting in improved Node creation/addition time to a Scene.
45  *
46  * The goal of this test is *NOT* to measure absolute performance, but to show
47  * creating and adding 300 Nodes to a scene does not take more than a
48  * particular threshold of time.
49  *
50  * The selected thresold is larger than actual observed time.
51  * It is not a benchmark value. It is good enough to catch the regression
52  * in performance, if any.

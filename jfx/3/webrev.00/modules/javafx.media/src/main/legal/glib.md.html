  6 You are receiving a copy of GNU Glib, Version: 2.58.2 in either source or
  7 object code in the JavaFX runtime or JavaFX SDK. The terms of the
  8 Oracle license do NOT apply to the GNU Glib, Version: 2.58.2; it is
  9 licensed under the following license, separately from the Oracle programs
 10 you receive. If you do not wish to install this library, you may delete
 11 this library:
 12 
 13    - On Linux systems: N/A (library is not present)
 14    - On Mac OS X systems: delete $(JAVA_HOME)/lib/libglib-lite.dylib
 15    - On Windows systems: delete $(JAVA_HOME)\bin\glib-lite.dll

 35                        Version 2.1, February 1999
 36 
 37  Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 38  51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 39  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 40  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 41 
 42 [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
 43  as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 44  the version number 2.1.]
 45 
 46                             Preamble
 47 
 48   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
 49 freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
 50 Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
 51 free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
 52 
 53   This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
 54 specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
 55 Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
 56 can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
 57 this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
 58 strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
 59 
 60   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
 61 not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
 62 you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
 63 for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
 64 it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
 65 it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
 66 these things.
 67 
 68   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
 69 distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
 70 rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
 71 you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
 72 
 73   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
 74 or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
 75 you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
 76 code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
 77 complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
 78 with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
 79 it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
 80 
 81   We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
 82 library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
 83 permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
 84 
 85   To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
 86 there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
 87 modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
 88 that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
 89 author&#39;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
 90 introduced by others.
 91 
 92   Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
 93 any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
 94 effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
 95 restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
 96 any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
 97 consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
 98 
 99   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
100 ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
101 General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
102 is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
103 this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
104 libraries into non-free programs.
105 
106   When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
107 a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
108 combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
109 General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
110 entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
111 Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
112 the library.
113 
114   We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it
115 does Less to protect the user&#39;s freedom than the ordinary General
116 Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
117 of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
118 are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
119 libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
120 special circumstances.
121 
122   For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
123 encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
124 a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
125 allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
126 library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
127 case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
128 software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
129 
130   In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
131 programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
132 free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
133 non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
134 operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
135 system.
136 
137   Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
138 users&#39; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
139 linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
140 that program using a modified version of the Library.
141 
142   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
143 modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
144 &quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.  The
145 former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
146 be combined with the library in order to run.
147 
148                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
149    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
150 
151   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
152 program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
153 other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
154 this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).
155 Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.
156 
157   A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data
158 prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
159 (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
160 
161   The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work
162 which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based on the
163 Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under
164 copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
165 portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
166 straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
167 included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)
168 
169   &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for
170 making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
171 all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
172 interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
173 and installation of the library.
174 
175   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
176 covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
177 running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
178 such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
179 on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
180 writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
181 and what the program that uses the Library does.
182 
183   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&#39;s
184 complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
185 you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
186 appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
187 all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
188 warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
189 Library.
190 
191   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
192 and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
193 fee.
194 
195   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
196 of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
197 distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
198 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
199 
200     a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
201 
202     b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
203     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
204 
205     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
206     charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
207 
208     d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
209     table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
210     the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
211     is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
212     in the event an application does not supply such function or
213     table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
214     its purpose remains meaningful.
215 
216     (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
217     a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
218     application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
219     application-supplied function or table used by this function must
220     be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
221     root function must still compute square roots.)
222 
223 These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
224 identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
225 and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
226 themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
227 sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
228 distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
229 on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
230 this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
231 entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
232 it.
233 
234 Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
235 your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
236 exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
237 collective works based on the Library.
238 
239 In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
240 with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
241 a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
242 the scope of this License.
243 
244   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
245 License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
246 this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
247 that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
248 instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
249 ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
250 that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
251 these notices.
252 
253   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
254 that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
255 subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
256 
257   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
258 the Library into a program that is not a library.
259 
260   4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
261 derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
262 under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
263 it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
264 must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
265 medium customarily used for software interchange.
266 
267   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
268 from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
269 source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
270 distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
271 compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
272 
273   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
274 Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
275 linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such a
276 work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
277 therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
278 
279   However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library
280 creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
281 contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the
282 library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
283 Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
284 
285   When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file
286 that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
287 derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
288 Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
289 linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
290 threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
291 
292   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
293 structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
294 functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
295 file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
296 work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
297 Library will still fall under Section 6.)
298 
299   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
300 distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
301 Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
302 whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
303 
304   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
305 link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a
306 work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
307 under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
308 modification of the work for the customer&#39;s own use and reverse
309 engineering for debugging such modifications.
310 
311   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
312 Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
313 this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
314 during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
315 copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
316 directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
317 of these things:
318 
319     a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
320     machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
321     changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
322     Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
323     with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that
324     uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the
325     user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
326     executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
327     that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
328     Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
329     to use the modified definitions.)
330 
331     b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
332     Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
333     copy of the library already present on the user&#39;s computer system,
334     rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
335     will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
336     the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
337     interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
338 
339     c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
340     least three years, to give the same user the materials
341     specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
342     than the cost of performing this distribution.
343 
344     d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
345     from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
346     specified materials from the same place.
347 
348     e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
349     materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
350 
351   For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the
352 Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for
353 reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
354 the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
355 normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
356 components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
357 which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
358 the executable.
359 
360   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
361 restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
362 accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
363 use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
364 distribute.
365 
366   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
367 Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
368 facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
369 library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
370 the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
371 permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
372 
373     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
374     based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
375     facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
376     Sections above.
377 
378     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
379     that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
380     where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
381 
382   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
383 the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
384 attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
385 distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
386 rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
387 or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
388 terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
389 
390   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
391 signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
392 distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
393 prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
394 modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
395 Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
396 all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
397 the Library or works based on it.
398 
399   10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
400 Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
401 original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
402 subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
403 restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.
404 You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
405 this License.
406 
407   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
408 infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
409 conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
410 otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
411 excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
412 distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
413 License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
414 may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
415 license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
416 all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
417 the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
418 refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
419 
420 If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
421 particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
422 and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
423 
424 It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
425 patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
426 such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
427 integrity of the free software distribution system which is
428 implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
429 generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
430 through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
431 system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
432 to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
433 impose that choice.
434 
435 This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
436 be a consequence of the rest of this License.
437 
438   12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
439 certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
440 original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
441 an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
442 so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
443 excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
444 written in the body of this License.
445 
446   13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
447 versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
448 Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
449 but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
450 
451 Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
452 specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
453 &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and
454 conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
455 the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
456 license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
457 the Free Software Foundation.
458 
459   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
460 programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
461 write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
462 copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
463 Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
464 decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
465 of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
466 and reuse of software generally.

493            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
494 
495   If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
496 possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
497 everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
498 redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
499 ordinary General Public License).
500 
501   To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
502 safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
503 convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
504 &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
505 
506     &lt;one line to give the library&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
507     Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;
508 
509     This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
510     modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
511     License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
512     version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
513 
514     This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
515     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
516     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
517     Lesser General Public License for more details.
518 
519     You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
520     License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
521     Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
522 
523 Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
524 
525 You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
526 school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library, if
527 necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
528 
529   Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
530   library `Frob&#39; (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.
531 
532   &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990
533   Ty Coon, President of Vice
534 
535 That&#39;s all there is to it!

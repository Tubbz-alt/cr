  			    Preamble
  
    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
  freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">- License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">- software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">- General Public License applies to most of the Free Software</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">- Foundation&#39;s software and to any other program whose authors commit to</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">- using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">- the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">- your programs, too.</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+ Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+ free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+ </span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+   This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+ specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+ other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+ your libraries, too.</span>
  
    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
  price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
  have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
  this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
  if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
  in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
  
    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
  anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">- These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">- distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">- </span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">-   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">- gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">- you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">- source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">- rights.</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">- </span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">-   We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">- (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">- distribute and/or modify the software.</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">- </span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">-   Also, for each author&#39;s protection and ours, we want to make certain</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+ These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+ you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+ </span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+ or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+ you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+ code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+ complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+ with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+ it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+ </span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+   Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+ the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+ permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ </span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+   Also, for each distributor&#39;s protection, we want to make certain</span>
  that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">- software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">- want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">- that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">- authors&#39; reputations.</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">- </span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+ library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+ want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+ version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+ the original authors&#39; reputations.</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+ </span>
    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">- patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">- program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">- program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">- patent must be licensed for everyone&#39;s free use or not licensed at all.</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+ patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+ software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+ transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+ we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone&#39;s</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ free use or not licensed at all.</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ </span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ one; be sure to read it in full, and don&#39;t assume that anything in it is</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ the same as in the ordinary license.</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ </span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+   The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ treats it as such.</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ </span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+   Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ </span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+   However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ will lead to faster development of free libraries.</span>
  
    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">- modification follow.</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+ modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ &quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.  The</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ works together with the library.</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ </span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+   Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ General Public License rather than by this special one.</span>

<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+     a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+     application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+     application-supplied function or table used by this function must</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+     be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square</span>

<span class="udiff-line-added">+ </span>
  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If

<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+ identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,</span>

  sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">- on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+ on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of</span>
  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
<span class="udiff-line-modified-removed">- entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+ entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ it.</span>

<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+ that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,</span>
<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+ instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the</span>

<span class="udiff-line-modified-added">+ from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the</span>

<span class="udiff-line-added">+ </span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such a</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ therefore falls outside the scope of this License.</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ </span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+   However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ </span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+   When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ </span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ Library will still fall under Section 6.)</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ </span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ </span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ modification of the work for the customer&#39;s own use and reverse</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ engineering for debugging such modifications.</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ </span>

<span class="udiff-line-added">+ Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ of these things:</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ </span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+     a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+     machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+     changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+     Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+     with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+     uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+     user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+     executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+     that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+     Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+     to use the modified definitions.)</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ </span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+     b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+     least three years, to give the same user the materials</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+     specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+     than the cost of performing this distribution.</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ </span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+     c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+     from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+     specified materials from the same place.</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ </span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+     d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+     materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ </span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+   For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ the executable.</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ </span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot</span>
<span class="udiff-line-added">+ use both them and the Library together in an executable that you</span>

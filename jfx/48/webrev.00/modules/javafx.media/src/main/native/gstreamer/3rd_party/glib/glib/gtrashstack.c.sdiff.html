 32  * @short_description: maintain a stack of unused allocated memory chunks
 33  *
 34  * A #GTrashStack is an efficient way to keep a stack of unused allocated
 35  * memory chunks. Each memory chunk is required to be large enough to hold
 36  * a #gpointer. This allows the stack to be maintained without any space
 37  * overhead, since the stack pointers can be stored inside the memory chunks.
 38  *
 39  * There is no function to create a #GTrashStack. A %NULL #GTrashStack*
 40  * is a perfectly valid empty stack.
 41  *
 42  * There is no longer any good reason to use #GTrashStack.  If you have
 43  * extra pieces of memory, free() them and allocate them again later.
 44  *
 45  * Deprecated: 2.48: #GTrashStack is deprecated without replacement

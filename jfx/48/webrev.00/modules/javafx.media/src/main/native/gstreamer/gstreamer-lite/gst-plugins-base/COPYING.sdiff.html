  6  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
  7  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  9 			    Preamble
 10 
 11   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
 12 freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
<span class="line-modified"> 13 License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 14 software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 15 General Public License applies to most of the Free Software</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 16 Foundation&#39;s software and to any other program whose authors commit to</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 17 using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 18 the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 19 your programs, too.</span>
 20 
 21   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
 22 price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
 23 have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
 24 this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
 25 if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
 26 in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
 27 
 28   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
 29 anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
<span class="line-modified"> 30 These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 31 distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 32 </span>
<span class="line-modified"> 33   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 34 gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 35 you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 36 source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 37 rights.</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 38 </span>
<span class="line-modified"> 39   We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 40 (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 41 distribute and/or modify the software.</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 42 </span>
<span class="line-modified"> 43   Also, for each author&#39;s protection and ours, we want to make certain</span>


 44 that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<span class="line-modified"> 45 software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 46 want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 47 that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 48 authors&#39; reputations.</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 49 </span>
 50   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
<span class="line-modified"> 51 patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 52 program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 53 program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 54 patent must be licensed for everyone&#39;s free use or not licensed at all.</span>
































 55 
 56   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<span class="line-modified"> 57 modification follow.</span>






 58 
<span class="line-modified"> 59 		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</span>
 60    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
 61 
<span class="line-modified"> 62   0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 63 a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 64 under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;, below,</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 65 refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot;</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 66 means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 67 that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 68 either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 69 language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 70 the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 71 </span>
<span class="line-modified"> 72 Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not</span>














 73 covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
<span class="line-modified"> 74 running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 75 is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 76 Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 77 Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 78 </span>
<span class="line-modified"> 79   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 80 source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 81 conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 82 copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 83 notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 84 and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 85 along with the Program.</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 86 </span>
<span class="line-modified"> 87 You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 88 you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 89 </span>
<span class="line-modified"> 90   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 91 of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and</span>


 92 distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
 93 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
 94 
<span class="line-modified"> 95     a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices</span>


 96     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
 97 
<span class="line-modified"> 98     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 99     whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any</span>
<span class="line-modified">100     part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third</span>
<span class="line-modified">101     parties under the terms of this License.</span>
<span class="line-modified">102 </span>
<span class="line-modified">103     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively</span>
<span class="line-modified">104     when run, you must cause it, when started running for such</span>
<span class="line-modified">105     interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an</span>
<span class="line-modified">106     announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a</span>
<span class="line-modified">107     notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide</span>
<span class="line-modified">108     a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under</span>
<span class="line-modified">109     these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this</span>
<span class="line-modified">110     License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but</span>
<span class="line-modified">111     does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on</span>
<span class="line-modified">112     the Program is not required to print an announcement.)</span>
<span class="line-modified">113 </span>


114 These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
<span class="line-modified">115 identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,</span>
116 and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
117 themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
118 sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
119 distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
<span class="line-modified">120 on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of</span>
121 this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
<span class="line-modified">122 entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</span>

123 
124 Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
125 your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
126 exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<span class="line-modified">127 collective works based on the Program.</span>
128 
<span class="line-modified">129 In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program</span>
<span class="line-modified">130 with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of</span>
131 a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
132 the scope of this License.
133 
<span class="line-modified">134   3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,</span>
<span class="line-modified">135 under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of</span>
<span class="line-modified">136 Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:</span>
<span class="line-modified">137 </span>
<span class="line-modified">138     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable</span>
<span class="line-modified">139     source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections</span>
<span class="line-modified">140     1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</span>
<span class="line-modified">141 </span>
<span class="line-modified">142     b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three</span>
<span class="line-modified">143     years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your</span>
<span class="line-modified">144     cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete</span>
<span class="line-modified">145     machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be</span>
<span class="line-modified">146     distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium</span>
<span class="line-modified">147     customarily used for software interchange; or,</span>
<span class="line-modified">148 </span>
<span class="line-modified">149     c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer</span>
<span class="line-modified">150     to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is</span>
<span class="line-modified">151     allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you</span>
<span class="line-modified">152     received the program in object code or executable form with such</span>
<span class="line-modified">153     an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)</span>
<span class="line-modified">154 </span>
<span class="line-modified">155 The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for</span>
<span class="line-modified">156 making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source</span>
<span class="line-modified">157 code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any</span>
<span class="line-modified">158 associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to</span>
<span class="line-modified">159 control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a</span>
<span class="line-modified">160 special exception, the source code distributed need not include</span>
<span class="line-removed">161 anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary</span>
<span class="line-removed">162 form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the</span>
<span class="line-removed">163 operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component</span>
<span class="line-removed">164 itself accompanies the executable.</span>
<span class="line-removed">165 </span>
<span class="line-removed">166 If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering</span>
<span class="line-removed">167 access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent</span>
<span class="line-removed">168 access to copy the source code from the same place counts as</span>
<span class="line-removed">169 distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not</span>
170 compelled to copy the source along with the object code.





















































































171 
<span class="line-modified">172   4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program</span>
<span class="line-modified">173 except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt</span>
<span class="line-modified">174 otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is</span>
<span class="line-modified">175 void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.</span>
<span class="line-modified">176 However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under</span>
<span class="line-modified">177 this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such</span>
<span class="line-modified">178 parties remain in full compliance.</span>
<span class="line-modified">179 </span>
<span class="line-modified">180   5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not</span>
















181 signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<span class="line-modified">182 distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are</span>
183 prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
<span class="line-modified">184 modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the</span>
<span class="line-modified">185 Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and</span>
186 all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
<span class="line-modified">187 the Program or works based on it.</span>
188 
<span class="line-modified">189   6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the</span>
<span class="line-modified">190 Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the</span>
<span class="line-modified">191 original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to</span>
<span class="line-modified">192 these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further</span>
193 restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.
194 You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
195 this License.
<span class="line-modified">196 </span>
<span class="line-modified">197   7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent</span>
198 infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
199 conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
200 otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
201 excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
202 distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
203 License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
<span class="line-modified">204 may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent</span>
<span class="line-modified">205 license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by</span>
206 all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
207 the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
<span class="line-modified">208 refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.</span>
209 
<span class="line-modified">210 If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under</span>
<span class="line-modified">211 any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to</span>
<span class="line-modified">212 apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other</span>
<span class="line-removed">213 circumstances.</span>
214 
215 It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
216 patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
217 such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<span class="line-modified">218 integrity of the free software distribution system, which is</span>
219 implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
220 generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
221 through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
222 system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
223 to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
224 impose that choice.
225 
226 This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
227 be a consequence of the rest of this License.
<span class="line-modified">228 </span>
<span class="line-modified">229   8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in</span>
230 certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<span class="line-modified">231 original copyright holder who places the Program under this License</span>
<span class="line-modified">232 may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding</span>
<span class="line-modified">233 those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among</span>
<span class="line-modified">234 countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates</span>
<span class="line-modified">235 the limitation as if written in the body of this License.</span>
<span class="line-modified">236 </span>
<span class="line-modified">237   9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions</span>
<span class="line-modified">238 of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will</span>
<span class="line-modified">239 be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to</span>
<span class="line-modified">240 address new problems or concerns.</span>
<span class="line-modified">241 </span>
<span class="line-modified">242 Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program</span>
<span class="line-modified">243 specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any</span>
<span class="line-modified">244 later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions</span>
<span class="line-modified">245 either of that version or of any later version published by the Free</span>
<span class="line-modified">246 Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of</span>
<span class="line-modified">247 this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software</span>
<span class="line-modified">248 Foundation.</span>
<span class="line-modified">249 </span>
<span class="line-modified">250   10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free</span>
<span class="line-modified">251 programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author</span>
<span class="line-modified">252 to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free</span>
<span class="line-modified">253 Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes</span>
<span class="line-modified">254 make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals</span>
<span class="line-modified">255 of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and</span>
<span class="line-modified">256 of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.</span>

257 
258 			    NO WARRANTY
259 
<span class="line-modified">260   11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY</span>
<span class="line-modified">261 FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN</span>
<span class="line-modified">262 OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES</span>
<span class="line-modified">263 PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED</span>
<span class="line-modified">264 OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF</span>
<span class="line-modified">265 MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS</span>
<span class="line-modified">266 TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE</span>
<span class="line-modified">267 PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,</span>
<span class="line-modified">268 REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</span>
<span class="line-modified">269 </span>
<span class="line-modified">270   12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING</span>
<span class="line-modified">271 WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR</span>
<span class="line-modified">272 REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,</span>
<span class="line-modified">273 INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING</span>
<span class="line-modified">274 OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED</span>
<span class="line-modified">275 TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY</span>
<span class="line-modified">276 YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER</span>
<span class="line-modified">277 PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE</span>
<span class="line-modified">278 POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</span>

279 
280 		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
281 
<span class="line-modified">282 	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</span>
283 
<span class="line-modified">284   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest</span>
<span class="line-modified">285 possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it</span>
<span class="line-modified">286 free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</span>


287 
<span class="line-modified">288   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest</span>
<span class="line-modified">289 to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively</span>
<span class="line-modified">290 convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least</span>
<span class="line-modified">291 the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</span>
292 
<span class="line-modified">293     &lt;one line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;</span>

<span class="line-modified">  4  Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.</span>
<span class="line-modified">  5                     51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA</span>
  6  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
  7  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

<span class="line-added">  9 [This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is</span>
<span class="line-added"> 10  numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]</span>
<span class="line-added"> 11 </span>
 12 			    Preamble
 13 
 14   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
 15 freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
<span class="line-modified"> 16 Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 17 free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 18 </span>
<span class="line-modified"> 19   This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 20 specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 21 other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 22 your libraries, too.</span>
 23 
 24   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
 25 price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
 26 have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
 27 this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
 28 if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
 29 in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
 30 
 31   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
 32 anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
<span class="line-modified"> 33 These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 34 you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 35 </span>
<span class="line-modified"> 36   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 37 or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 38 you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 39 code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 40 complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 41 with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 42 it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 43 </span>
<span class="line-modified"> 44   Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 45 the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 46 permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.</span>
<span class="line-added"> 47 </span>
<span class="line-added"> 48   Also, for each distributor&#39;s protection, we want to make certain</span>
 49 that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<span class="line-modified"> 50 library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 51 want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 52 version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 53 the original authors&#39; reputations.</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 54 </span>
 55   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
<span class="line-modified"> 56 patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 57 software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 58 transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 59 we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone&#39;s</span>
<span class="line-added"> 60 free use or not licensed at all.</span>
<span class="line-added"> 61 </span>
<span class="line-added"> 62   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary</span>
<span class="line-added"> 63 GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This</span>
<span class="line-added"> 64 license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain</span>
<span class="line-added"> 65 designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary</span>
<span class="line-added"> 66 one; be sure to read it in full, and don&#39;t assume that anything in it is</span>
<span class="line-added"> 67 the same as in the ordinary license.</span>
<span class="line-added"> 68 </span>
<span class="line-added"> 69   The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that</span>
<span class="line-added"> 70 they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a</span>
<span class="line-added"> 71 program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without</span>
<span class="line-added"> 72 changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is</span>
<span class="line-added"> 73 analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in</span>
<span class="line-added"> 74 a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a</span>
<span class="line-added"> 75 derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License</span>
<span class="line-added"> 76 treats it as such.</span>
<span class="line-added"> 77 </span>
<span class="line-added"> 78   Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General</span>
<span class="line-added"> 79 Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software</span>
<span class="line-added"> 80 sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We</span>
<span class="line-added"> 81 concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.</span>
<span class="line-added"> 82 </span>
<span class="line-added"> 83   However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the</span>
<span class="line-added"> 84 users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the</span>
<span class="line-added"> 85 libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to</span>
<span class="line-added"> 86 permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while</span>
<span class="line-added"> 87 preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free</span>
<span class="line-added"> 88 libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve</span>
<span class="line-added"> 89 this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards</span>
<span class="line-added"> 90 changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this</span>
<span class="line-added"> 91 will lead to faster development of free libraries.</span>
 92 
 93   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<span class="line-modified"> 94 modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a</span>
<span class="line-added"> 95 &quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.  The</span>
<span class="line-added"> 96 former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only</span>
<span class="line-added"> 97 works together with the library.</span>
<span class="line-added"> 98 </span>
<span class="line-added"> 99   Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary</span>
<span class="line-added">100 General Public License rather than by this special one.</span>
101 
<span class="line-modified">102 		  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</span>
103    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
104 
<span class="line-modified">105   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which</span>
<span class="line-modified">106 contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized</span>
<span class="line-modified">107 party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library</span>
<span class="line-modified">108 General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).  Each licensee is</span>
<span class="line-modified">109 addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</span>
<span class="line-modified">110 </span>
<span class="line-modified">111   A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data</span>
<span class="line-modified">112 prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs</span>
<span class="line-modified">113 (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.</span>
<span class="line-modified">114 </span>
<span class="line-modified">115   The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work</span>
<span class="line-added">116 which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based on the</span>
<span class="line-added">117 Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under</span>
<span class="line-added">118 copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a</span>
<span class="line-added">119 portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated</span>
<span class="line-added">120 straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is</span>
<span class="line-added">121 included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)</span>
<span class="line-added">122 </span>
<span class="line-added">123   &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for</span>
<span class="line-added">124 making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means</span>
<span class="line-added">125 all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated</span>
<span class="line-added">126 interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation</span>
<span class="line-added">127 and installation of the library.</span>
<span class="line-added">128 </span>
<span class="line-added">129   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not</span>
130 covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
<span class="line-modified">131 running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from</span>
<span class="line-modified">132 such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based</span>
<span class="line-modified">133 on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for</span>
<span class="line-modified">134 writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does</span>
<span class="line-modified">135 and what the program that uses the Library does.</span>
<span class="line-modified">136   </span>
<span class="line-modified">137   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&#39;s</span>
<span class="line-modified">138 complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that</span>
<span class="line-modified">139 you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an</span>
<span class="line-modified">140 appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact</span>
<span class="line-modified">141 all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any</span>
<span class="line-modified">142 warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the</span>
<span class="line-modified">143 Library.</span>
<span class="line-modified">144 </span>
<span class="line-modified">145   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,</span>
<span class="line-modified">146 and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a</span>
<span class="line-modified">147 fee.</span>
<span class="line-modified">148 </span>
<span class="line-added">149   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion</span>
<span class="line-added">150 of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and</span>
151 distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
152 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
153 
<span class="line-modified">154     a) The modified work must itself be a software library.</span>
<span class="line-added">155 </span>
<span class="line-added">156     b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices</span>
157     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
158 
<span class="line-modified">159     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no</span>
<span class="line-modified">160     charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.</span>
<span class="line-modified">161 </span>
<span class="line-modified">162     d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a</span>
<span class="line-modified">163     table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses</span>
<span class="line-modified">164     the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility</span>
<span class="line-modified">165     is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,</span>
<span class="line-modified">166     in the event an application does not supply such function or</span>
<span class="line-modified">167     table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of</span>
<span class="line-modified">168     its purpose remains meaningful.</span>
<span class="line-modified">169 </span>
<span class="line-modified">170     (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has</span>
<span class="line-modified">171     a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the</span>
<span class="line-modified">172     application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any</span>
<span class="line-modified">173     application-supplied function or table used by this function must</span>
<span class="line-modified">174     be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square</span>
<span class="line-added">175     root function must still compute square roots.)</span>
<span class="line-added">176 </span>
177 These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
<span class="line-modified">178 identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,</span>
179 and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
180 themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
181 sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
182 distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
<span class="line-modified">183 on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of</span>
184 this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
<span class="line-modified">185 entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote</span>
<span class="line-added">186 it.</span>
187 
188 Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
189 your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
190 exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<span class="line-modified">191 collective works based on the Library.</span>
192 
<span class="line-modified">193 In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library</span>
<span class="line-modified">194 with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of</span>
195 a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
196 the scope of this License.
197 
<span class="line-modified">198   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public</span>
<span class="line-modified">199 License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do</span>
<span class="line-modified">200 this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so</span>
<span class="line-modified">201 that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,</span>
<span class="line-modified">202 instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the</span>
<span class="line-modified">203 ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify</span>
<span class="line-modified">204 that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in</span>
<span class="line-modified">205 these notices.</span>
<span class="line-modified">206 </span>
<span class="line-modified">207   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for</span>
<span class="line-modified">208 that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all</span>
<span class="line-modified">209 subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.</span>
<span class="line-modified">210 </span>
<span class="line-modified">211   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of</span>
<span class="line-modified">212 the Library into a program that is not a library.</span>
<span class="line-modified">213 </span>
<span class="line-modified">214   4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or</span>
<span class="line-modified">215 derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form</span>
<span class="line-modified">216 under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany</span>
<span class="line-modified">217 it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which</span>
<span class="line-modified">218 must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a</span>
<span class="line-modified">219 medium customarily used for software interchange.</span>
<span class="line-modified">220 </span>
<span class="line-modified">221   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy</span>
<span class="line-modified">222 from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the</span>
<span class="line-modified">223 source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to</span>
<span class="line-modified">224 distribute the source code, even though third parties are not</span>









225 compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
<span class="line-added">226 </span>
<span class="line-added">227   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the</span>
<span class="line-added">228 Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or</span>
<span class="line-added">229 linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such a</span>
<span class="line-added">230 work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and</span>
<span class="line-added">231 therefore falls outside the scope of this License.</span>
<span class="line-added">232 </span>
<span class="line-added">233   However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library</span>
<span class="line-added">234 creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it</span>
<span class="line-added">235 contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the</span>
<span class="line-added">236 library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.</span>
<span class="line-added">237 Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.</span>
<span class="line-added">238 </span>
<span class="line-added">239   When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file</span>
<span class="line-added">240 that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a</span>
<span class="line-added">241 derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.</span>
<span class="line-added">242 Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be</span>
<span class="line-added">243 linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The</span>
<span class="line-added">244 threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.</span>
<span class="line-added">245 </span>
<span class="line-added">246   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data</span>
<span class="line-added">247 structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline</span>
<span class="line-added">248 functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object</span>
<span class="line-added">249 file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative</span>
<span class="line-added">250 work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the</span>
<span class="line-added">251 Library will still fall under Section 6.)</span>
<span class="line-added">252 </span>
<span class="line-added">253   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may</span>
<span class="line-added">254 distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.</span>
<span class="line-added">255 Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,</span>
<span class="line-added">256 whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.</span>
<span class="line-added">257 </span>
<span class="line-added">258   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or</span>
<span class="line-added">259 link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a</span>
<span class="line-added">260 work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work</span>
<span class="line-added">261 under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit</span>
<span class="line-added">262 modification of the work for the customer&#39;s own use and reverse</span>
<span class="line-added">263 engineering for debugging such modifications.</span>
<span class="line-added">264 </span>
<span class="line-added">265   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the</span>
<span class="line-added">266 Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by</span>
<span class="line-added">267 this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work</span>
<span class="line-added">268 during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the</span>
<span class="line-added">269 copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference</span>
<span class="line-added">270 directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one</span>
<span class="line-added">271 of these things:</span>
<span class="line-added">272 </span>
<span class="line-added">273     a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding</span>
<span class="line-added">274     machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever</span>
<span class="line-added">275     changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under</span>
<span class="line-added">276     Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked</span>
<span class="line-added">277     with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that</span>
<span class="line-added">278     uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the</span>
<span class="line-added">279     user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified</span>
<span class="line-added">280     executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood</span>
<span class="line-added">281     that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the</span>
<span class="line-added">282     Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application</span>
<span class="line-added">283     to use the modified definitions.)</span>
<span class="line-added">284 </span>
<span class="line-added">285     b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at</span>
<span class="line-added">286     least three years, to give the same user the materials</span>
<span class="line-added">287     specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more</span>
<span class="line-added">288     than the cost of performing this distribution.</span>
<span class="line-added">289 </span>
<span class="line-added">290     c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy</span>
<span class="line-added">291     from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above</span>
<span class="line-added">292     specified materials from the same place.</span>
<span class="line-added">293 </span>
<span class="line-added">294     d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these</span>
<span class="line-added">295     materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.</span>
<span class="line-added">296 </span>
<span class="line-added">297   For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the</span>
<span class="line-added">298 Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for</span>
<span class="line-added">299 reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,</span>
<span class="line-added">300 the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally</span>
<span class="line-added">301 distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major</span>
<span class="line-added">302 components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on</span>
<span class="line-added">303 which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies</span>
<span class="line-added">304 the executable.</span>
<span class="line-added">305 </span>
<span class="line-added">306   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license</span>
<span class="line-added">307 restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally</span>
<span class="line-added">308 accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot</span>
<span class="line-added">309 use both them and the Library together in an executable that you</span>
<span class="line-added">310 distribute.</span>
311 
<span class="line-modified">312   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the</span>
<span class="line-modified">313 Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library</span>
<span class="line-modified">314 facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined</span>
<span class="line-modified">315 library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on</span>
<span class="line-modified">316 the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise</span>
<span class="line-modified">317 permitted, and provided that you do these two things:</span>
<span class="line-modified">318 </span>
<span class="line-modified">319     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work</span>
<span class="line-modified">320     based on the Library, uncombined with any other library</span>
<span class="line-added">321     facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the</span>
<span class="line-added">322     Sections above.</span>
<span class="line-added">323 </span>
<span class="line-added">324     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact</span>
<span class="line-added">325     that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining</span>
<span class="line-added">326     where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</span>
<span class="line-added">327 </span>
<span class="line-added">328   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute</span>
<span class="line-added">329 the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any</span>
<span class="line-added">330 attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or</span>
<span class="line-added">331 distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your</span>
<span class="line-added">332 rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,</span>
<span class="line-added">333 or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses</span>
<span class="line-added">334 terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</span>
<span class="line-added">335 </span>
<span class="line-added">336   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not</span>
337 signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<span class="line-modified">338 distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are</span>
339 prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
<span class="line-modified">340 modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the</span>
<span class="line-modified">341 Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and</span>
342 all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
<span class="line-modified">343 the Library or works based on it.</span>
344 
<span class="line-modified">345   10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the</span>
<span class="line-modified">346 Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the</span>
<span class="line-modified">347 original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library</span>
<span class="line-modified">348 subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further</span>
349 restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.
350 You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
351 this License.
<span class="line-modified">352 </span>
<span class="line-modified">353   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent</span>
354 infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
355 conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
356 otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
357 excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
358 distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
359 License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
<span class="line-modified">360 may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent</span>
<span class="line-modified">361 license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by</span>
362 all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
363 the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
<span class="line-modified">364 refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.</span>
365 
<span class="line-modified">366 If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any</span>
<span class="line-modified">367 particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,</span>
<span class="line-modified">368 and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.</span>

369 
370 It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
371 patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
372 such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<span class="line-modified">373 integrity of the free software distribution system which is</span>
374 implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
375 generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
376 through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
377 system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
378 to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
379 impose that choice.
380 
381 This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
382 be a consequence of the rest of this License.
<span class="line-modified">383 </span>
<span class="line-modified">384   12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in</span>
385 certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<span class="line-modified">386 original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add</span>
<span class="line-modified">387 an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,</span>
<span class="line-modified">388 so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus</span>
<span class="line-modified">389 excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if</span>
<span class="line-modified">390 written in the body of this License.</span>
<span class="line-modified">391 </span>
<span class="line-modified">392   13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new</span>
<span class="line-modified">393 versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.</span>
<span class="line-modified">394 Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,</span>
<span class="line-modified">395 but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</span>
<span class="line-modified">396 </span>
<span class="line-modified">397 Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library</span>
<span class="line-modified">398 specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and</span>
<span class="line-modified">399 &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and</span>
<span class="line-modified">400 conditions either of that version or of any later version published by</span>
<span class="line-modified">401 the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a</span>
<span class="line-modified">402 license version number, you may choose any version ever published by</span>
<span class="line-modified">403 the Free Software Foundation.</span>
<span class="line-modified">404 </span>
<span class="line-modified">405   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free</span>
<span class="line-modified">406 programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,</span>
<span class="line-modified">407 write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is</span>
<span class="line-modified">408 copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free</span>
<span class="line-modified">409 Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our</span>
<span class="line-modified">410 decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status</span>
<span class="line-modified">411 of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing</span>
<span class="line-added">412 and reuse of software generally.</span>
413 
414 			    NO WARRANTY
415 
<span class="line-modified">416   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO</span>
<span class="line-modified">417 WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.</span>
<span class="line-modified">418 EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR</span>
<span class="line-modified">419 OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY</span>
<span class="line-modified">420 KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE</span>
<span class="line-modified">421 IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR</span>
<span class="line-modified">422 PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE</span>
<span class="line-modified">423 LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME</span>
<span class="line-modified">424 THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</span>
<span class="line-modified">425 </span>
<span class="line-modified">426   16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN</span>
<span class="line-modified">427 WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY</span>
<span class="line-modified">428 AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU</span>
<span class="line-modified">429 FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR</span>
<span class="line-modified">430 CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE</span>
<span class="line-modified">431 LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING</span>
<span class="line-modified">432 RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A</span>
<span class="line-modified">433 FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF</span>
<span class="line-modified">434 SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH</span>
<span class="line-added">435 DAMAGES.</span>
436 
437 		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
438 
<span class="line-modified">439      Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries</span>
440 
<span class="line-modified">441   If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest</span>
<span class="line-modified">442 possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that</span>
<span class="line-modified">443 everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting</span>
<span class="line-added">444 redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the</span>
<span class="line-added">445 ordinary General Public License).</span>
446 
<span class="line-modified">447   To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is</span>
<span class="line-modified">448 safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively</span>
<span class="line-modified">449 convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the</span>
<span class="line-modified">450 &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</span>
451 
<span class="line-modified">452     &lt;one line to give the library&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;</span>
<span class="line-modified">453     Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;</span>
454 
<span class="line-modified">455     This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or</span>
<span class="line-modified">456     modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public</span>
<span class="line-modified">457     License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either</span>
<span class="line-modified">458     version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.</span>
459 
<span class="line-modified">460     This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,</span>
461     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<span class="line-modified">462     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU</span>
<span class="line-modified">463     Library General Public License for more details.</span>




464 
<span class="line-added">465     You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public</span>
<span class="line-added">466     License along with this library; if not, write to the Free</span>
<span class="line-added">467     Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA.</span>
468 
469 Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
470 













471 You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<span class="line-modified">472 school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library, if</span>
473 necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
474 
<span class="line-modified">475   Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the</span>
<span class="line-modified">476   library `Frob&#39; (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.</span>

 67        * - The first block in a row is always mapped to memory block &#39;y * width&#39;.
 68        * - For all even rows, except for the last one when &#39;y&#39; is odd, from the first
 69        *   block number an offset is then added to obtain the block number for
 70        *   the other blocks in the row. The offset is &#39;x&#39; plus the corresponding
 71        *   number in the series [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 8, 8, 8, 8, 12, ...], which can be
 72        *   expressed as &#39;GST_ROUND_DOWN_4 (x + 2)&#39;.
 73        *       f(x,y,width,height) = y * width + x + GST_ROUND_DOWN_4 (x + 2)
 74        *
 75        * - For the last row when &#39;y&#39; is odd the offset is simply &#39;x&#39;.
 76        *       f(x,y,width,height) = y * width + x
 77        * - Note that &#39;y&#39; is even, so &#39;GST_ROUNDOWN_2 (y) == y&#39; in this case
 78        *
 79        *  For odd rows:
 80        * - The first block in the row is always mapped to memory block
 81        *   &#39;GST_ROUND_DOWN_2(y) * width + 2&#39;.
 82        * - From the first block number an offset is then added to obtain the block
 83        *   number for the other blocks in the row. The offset is &#39;x&#39; plus the
 84        *   corresponding number in the series [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 8, 8, 8, 8, 12, ...],
 85        *   which can be  expressed as GST_ROUND_DOWN_4 (x).

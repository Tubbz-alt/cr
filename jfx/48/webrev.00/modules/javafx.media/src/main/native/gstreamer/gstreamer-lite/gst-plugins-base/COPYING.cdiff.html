<span class="line-modified">!  Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.</span>
<span class="line-modified">!                        51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA</span>
   Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
   of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
  
  			    Preamble
  
    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
  freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
<span class="line-modified">! License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free</span>
<span class="line-modified">! software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This</span>
<span class="line-modified">! General Public License applies to most of the Free Software</span>
<span class="line-modified">! Foundation&#39;s software and to any other program whose authors commit to</span>
<span class="line-modified">! using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by</span>
<span class="line-modified">! the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to</span>
<span class="line-modified">! your programs, too.</span>
  
    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
  price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
  have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
  this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
  if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
  in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
  
    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
  anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
<span class="line-modified">! These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you</span>
<span class="line-modified">! distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.</span>
<span class="line-modified">! </span>
<span class="line-modified">!   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether</span>
<span class="line-modified">! gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that</span>
<span class="line-modified">! you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the</span>
<span class="line-modified">! source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their</span>
<span class="line-modified">! rights.</span>
<span class="line-modified">! </span>
<span class="line-modified">!   We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and</span>
<span class="line-modified">! (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,</span>
<span class="line-modified">! distribute and/or modify the software.</span>
<span class="line-modified">! </span>
<span class="line-modified">!   Also, for each author&#39;s protection and ours, we want to make certain</span>
  that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<span class="line-modified">! software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we</span>
<span class="line-modified">! want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so</span>
<span class="line-modified">! that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original</span>
<span class="line-modified">! authors&#39; reputations.</span>
<span class="line-modified">! </span>
    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
<span class="line-modified">! patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free</span>
<span class="line-modified">! program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the</span>
<span class="line-modified">! program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any</span>
<span class="line-modified">! patent must be licensed for everyone&#39;s free use or not licensed at all.</span>
  
    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<span class="line-modified">! modification follow.</span>
  
<span class="line-modified">! 		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</span>
     TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
  
<span class="line-modified">!   0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains</span>
<span class="line-modified">! a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed</span>
<span class="line-modified">! under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;, below,</span>
<span class="line-modified">! refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot;</span>
<span class="line-modified">! means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:</span>
<span class="line-modified">! that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,</span>
<span class="line-modified">! either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another</span>
<span class="line-modified">! language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in</span>
<span class="line-modified">! the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</span>
<span class="line-modified">! </span>
<span class="line-modified">! Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not</span>
  covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
<span class="line-modified">! running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program</span>
<span class="line-modified">! is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the</span>
<span class="line-modified">! Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).</span>
<span class="line-modified">! Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.</span>
<span class="line-modified">! </span>
<span class="line-modified">!   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s</span>
<span class="line-modified">! source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you</span>
<span class="line-modified">! conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate</span>
<span class="line-modified">! copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the</span>
<span class="line-modified">! notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;</span>
<span class="line-modified">! and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License</span>
<span class="line-modified">! along with the Program.</span>
<span class="line-modified">! </span>
<span class="line-modified">! You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and</span>
<span class="line-modified">! you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</span>
<span class="line-modified">! </span>
<span class="line-modified">!   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion</span>
<span class="line-modified">! of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and</span>
  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
  above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
  
<span class="line-modified">!     a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices</span>
      stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
  
<span class="line-modified">!     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in</span>
<span class="line-modified">!     whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any</span>
<span class="line-modified">!     part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third</span>
<span class="line-modified">!     parties under the terms of this License.</span>
<span class="line-modified">! </span>
<span class="line-modified">!     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively</span>
<span class="line-modified">!     when run, you must cause it, when started running for such</span>
<span class="line-modified">!     interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an</span>
<span class="line-modified">!     announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a</span>
<span class="line-modified">!     notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide</span>
<span class="line-modified">!     a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under</span>
<span class="line-modified">!     these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this</span>
<span class="line-modified">!     License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but</span>
<span class="line-modified">!     does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on</span>
<span class="line-modified">!     the Program is not required to print an announcement.)</span>
<span class="line-modified">! </span>
  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
<span class="line-modified">! identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,</span>
  and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
  sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
<span class="line-modified">! on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of</span>
  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
<span class="line-modified">! entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</span>
  
  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<span class="line-modified">! collective works based on the Program.</span>
  
<span class="line-modified">! In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program</span>
<span class="line-modified">! with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of</span>
  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
  the scope of this License.
  
<span class="line-modified">!   3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,</span>
<span class="line-modified">! under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of</span>
<span class="line-modified">! Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:</span>
<span class="line-modified">! </span>
<span class="line-modified">!     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable</span>
<span class="line-modified">!     source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections</span>
<span class="line-modified">!     1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</span>
<span class="line-modified">! </span>
<span class="line-modified">!     b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three</span>
<span class="line-modified">!     years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your</span>
<span class="line-modified">!     cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete</span>
<span class="line-modified">!     machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be</span>
<span class="line-modified">!     distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium</span>
<span class="line-modified">!     customarily used for software interchange; or,</span>
<span class="line-modified">! </span>
<span class="line-modified">!     c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer</span>
<span class="line-modified">!     to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is</span>
<span class="line-modified">!     allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you</span>
<span class="line-modified">!     received the program in object code or executable form with such</span>
<span class="line-modified">!     an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)</span>
<span class="line-modified">! </span>
<span class="line-modified">! The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for</span>
<span class="line-modified">! making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source</span>
<span class="line-modified">! code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any</span>
<span class="line-modified">! associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to</span>
<span class="line-modified">! control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a</span>
<span class="line-modified">! special exception, the source code distributed need not include</span>
<span class="line-removed">- anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary</span>
<span class="line-removed">- form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the</span>
<span class="line-removed">- operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component</span>
<span class="line-removed">- itself accompanies the executable.</span>
<span class="line-removed">- </span>
<span class="line-removed">- If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering</span>
<span class="line-removed">- access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent</span>
<span class="line-removed">- access to copy the source code from the same place counts as</span>
<span class="line-removed">- distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not</span>
  compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
  
<span class="line-modified">!   4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program</span>
<span class="line-modified">! except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt</span>
<span class="line-modified">! otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is</span>
<span class="line-modified">! void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.</span>
<span class="line-modified">! However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under</span>
<span class="line-modified">! this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such</span>
<span class="line-modified">! parties remain in full compliance.</span>
<span class="line-modified">! </span>
<span class="line-modified">!   5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not</span>
  signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<span class="line-modified">! distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are</span>
  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
<span class="line-modified">! modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the</span>
<span class="line-modified">! Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and</span>
  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
<span class="line-modified">! the Program or works based on it.</span>
  
<span class="line-modified">!   6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the</span>
<span class="line-modified">! Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the</span>
<span class="line-modified">! original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to</span>
<span class="line-modified">! these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further</span>
  restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.
  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
  this License.
<span class="line-modified">! </span>
<span class="line-modified">!   7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent</span>
  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
  excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
<span class="line-modified">! may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent</span>
<span class="line-modified">! license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by</span>
  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
<span class="line-modified">! refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.</span>
  
<span class="line-modified">! If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under</span>
<span class="line-modified">! any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to</span>
<span class="line-modified">! apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other</span>
<span class="line-removed">- circumstances.</span>
  
  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<span class="line-modified">! integrity of the free software distribution system, which is</span>
  implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
  to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
  impose that choice.
  
  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
  be a consequence of the rest of this License.
<span class="line-modified">! </span>
<span class="line-modified">!   8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in</span>
  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<span class="line-modified">! original copyright holder who places the Program under this License</span>
<span class="line-modified">! may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding</span>
<span class="line-modified">! those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among</span>
<span class="line-modified">! countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates</span>
<span class="line-modified">! the limitation as if written in the body of this License.</span>
<span class="line-modified">! </span>
<span class="line-modified">!   9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions</span>
<span class="line-modified">! of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will</span>
<span class="line-modified">! be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to</span>
<span class="line-modified">! address new problems or concerns.</span>
<span class="line-modified">! </span>
<span class="line-modified">! Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program</span>
<span class="line-modified">! specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any</span>
<span class="line-modified">! later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions</span>
<span class="line-modified">! either of that version or of any later version published by the Free</span>
<span class="line-modified">! Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of</span>
<span class="line-modified">! this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software</span>
<span class="line-modified">! Foundation.</span>
<span class="line-modified">! </span>
<span class="line-modified">!   10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free</span>
<span class="line-modified">! programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author</span>
<span class="line-modified">! to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free</span>
<span class="line-modified">! Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes</span>
<span class="line-modified">! make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals</span>
<span class="line-modified">! of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and</span>
<span class="line-modified">! of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.</span>
  
  			    NO WARRANTY
  
<span class="line-modified">!   11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY</span>
<span class="line-modified">! FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN</span>
<span class="line-modified">! OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES</span>
<span class="line-modified">! PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED</span>
<span class="line-modified">! OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF</span>
<span class="line-modified">! MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS</span>
<span class="line-modified">! TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE</span>
<span class="line-modified">! PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,</span>
<span class="line-modified">! REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</span>
<span class="line-modified">! </span>
<span class="line-modified">!   12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING</span>
<span class="line-modified">! WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR</span>
<span class="line-modified">! REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,</span>
<span class="line-modified">! INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING</span>
<span class="line-modified">! OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED</span>
<span class="line-modified">! TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY</span>
<span class="line-modified">! YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER</span>
<span class="line-modified">! PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE</span>
<span class="line-modified">! POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</span>
  
  		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
  
<span class="line-modified">! 	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</span>
  
<span class="line-modified">!   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest</span>
<span class="line-modified">! possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it</span>
<span class="line-modified">! free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</span>
  
<span class="line-modified">!   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest</span>
<span class="line-modified">! to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively</span>
<span class="line-modified">! convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least</span>
<span class="line-modified">! the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</span>
  
<span class="line-modified">!     &lt;one line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;</span>
<span class="line-modified">!     Copyright (C) 19yy  &lt;name of author&gt;</span>

<span class="line-modified">!     (at your option) any later version.</span>
  
<span class="line-modified">!     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,</span>
      but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of

    The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
  freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
<span class="line-modified">! Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change</span>
<span class="line-modified">! free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.</span>
<span class="line-modified">! </span>
<span class="line-modified">!   This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some</span>
<span class="line-modified">! specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any</span>
<span class="line-modified">! other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for</span>
<span class="line-modified">! your libraries, too.</span>
  
    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
  price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you

  this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
  if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
  in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
  
    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
  anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
<span class="line-modified">! These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if</span>
<span class="line-modified">! you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.</span>
<span class="line-modified">! </span>
<span class="line-modified">!   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis</span>
<span class="line-modified">! or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave</span>
<span class="line-modified">! you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source</span>
<span class="line-modified">! code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide</span>
<span class="line-modified">! complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them</span>
<span class="line-modified">! with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling</span>
<span class="line-modified">! it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</span>
<span class="line-modified">! </span>
<span class="line-modified">!   Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright</span>
<span class="line-modified">! the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal</span>
<span class="line-modified">! permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.</span>
<span class="line-added">+ </span>
<span class="line-added">+   Also, for each distributor&#39;s protection, we want to make certain</span>
  that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<span class="line-modified">! library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we</span>
<span class="line-modified">! want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original</span>
<span class="line-modified">! version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on</span>
<span class="line-modified">! the original authors&#39; reputations.</span>
<span class="line-modified">! </span>
    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
<span class="line-modified">! patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free</span>
<span class="line-modified">! software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect</span>
<span class="line-modified">! transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,</span>
<span class="line-modified">! we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone&#39;s</span>
<span class="line-added">+ free use or not licensed at all.</span>
<span class="line-added">+ </span>
<span class="line-added">+   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary</span>
<span class="line-added">+ GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This</span>
<span class="line-added">+ license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain</span>
<span class="line-added">+ designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary</span>
<span class="line-added">+ one; be sure to read it in full, and don&#39;t assume that anything in it is</span>
<span class="line-added">+ the same as in the ordinary license.</span>
<span class="line-added">+ </span>
<span class="line-added">+   The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that</span>
<span class="line-added">+ they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a</span>
<span class="line-added">+ program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without</span>
<span class="line-added">+ changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is</span>
<span class="line-added">+ analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in</span>
<span class="line-added">+ a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a</span>
<span class="line-added">+ derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License</span>
<span class="line-added">+ treats it as such.</span>
<span class="line-added">+ </span>
<span class="line-added">+   Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General</span>
<span class="line-added">+ Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software</span>
<span class="line-added">+ sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We</span>
<span class="line-added">+ concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.</span>
<span class="line-added">+ </span>
<span class="line-added">+   However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the</span>
<span class="line-added">+ users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the</span>
<span class="line-added">+ libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to</span>
<span class="line-added">+ permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while</span>
<span class="line-added">+ preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free</span>
<span class="line-added">+ libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve</span>
<span class="line-added">+ this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards</span>
<span class="line-added">+ changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this</span>
<span class="line-added">+ will lead to faster development of free libraries.</span>
  
    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<span class="line-modified">! modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a</span>
<span class="line-added">+ &quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.  The</span>
<span class="line-added">+ former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only</span>
<span class="line-added">+ works together with the library.</span>
<span class="line-added">+ </span>
<span class="line-added">+   Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary</span>
<span class="line-added">+ General Public License rather than by this special one.</span>
  
<span class="line-modified">! 		  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</span>
     TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
  
<span class="line-modified">!   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which</span>
<span class="line-modified">! contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized</span>
<span class="line-modified">! party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library</span>
<span class="line-modified">! General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).  Each licensee is</span>
<span class="line-modified">! addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</span>
<span class="line-modified">! </span>
<span class="line-modified">!   A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data</span>
<span class="line-modified">! prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs</span>
<span class="line-modified">! (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.</span>
<span class="line-modified">! </span>
<span class="line-modified">!   The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work</span>
<span class="line-added">+ which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based on the</span>
<span class="line-added">+ Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under</span>
<span class="line-added">+ copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a</span>
<span class="line-added">+ portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated</span>
<span class="line-added">+ straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is</span>
<span class="line-added">+ included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)</span>
<span class="line-added">+ </span>
<span class="line-added">+   &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for</span>
<span class="line-added">+ making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means</span>
<span class="line-added">+ all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated</span>
<span class="line-added">+ interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation</span>
<span class="line-added">+ and installation of the library.</span>
<span class="line-added">+ </span>
<span class="line-added">+   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not</span>
  covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
<span class="line-modified">! running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from</span>
<span class="line-modified">! such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based</span>
<span class="line-modified">! on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for</span>
<span class="line-modified">! writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does</span>
<span class="line-modified">! and what the program that uses the Library does.</span>
<span class="line-modified">!   </span>
<span class="line-modified">!   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&#39;s</span>
<span class="line-modified">! complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that</span>
<span class="line-modified">! you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an</span>
<span class="line-modified">! appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact</span>
<span class="line-modified">! all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any</span>
<span class="line-modified">! warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the</span>
<span class="line-modified">! Library.</span>
<span class="line-modified">! </span>
<span class="line-modified">!   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,</span>
<span class="line-modified">! and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a</span>
<span class="line-modified">! fee.</span>
<span class="line-modified">! </span>
<span class="line-added">+   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion</span>
<span class="line-added">+ of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and</span>
  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
  above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
  
<span class="line-modified">!     a) The modified work must itself be a software library.</span>
<span class="line-added">+ </span>
<span class="line-added">+     b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices</span>
      stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
  
<span class="line-modified">!     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no</span>
<span class="line-modified">!     charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.</span>
<span class="line-modified">! </span>
<span class="line-modified">!     d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a</span>
<span class="line-modified">!     table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses</span>
<span class="line-modified">!     the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility</span>
<span class="line-modified">!     is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,</span>
<span class="line-modified">!     in the event an application does not supply such function or</span>
<span class="line-modified">!     table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of</span>
<span class="line-modified">!     its purpose remains meaningful.</span>
<span class="line-modified">! </span>
<span class="line-modified">!     (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has</span>
<span class="line-modified">!     a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the</span>
<span class="line-modified">!     application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any</span>
<span class="line-modified">!     application-supplied function or table used by this function must</span>
<span class="line-modified">!     be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square</span>
<span class="line-added">+     root function must still compute square roots.)</span>
<span class="line-added">+ </span>
  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
<span class="line-modified">! identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,</span>
  and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
  sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
<span class="line-modified">! on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of</span>
  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
<span class="line-modified">! entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote</span>
<span class="line-added">+ it.</span>
  
  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<span class="line-modified">! collective works based on the Library.</span>
  
<span class="line-modified">! In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library</span>
<span class="line-modified">! with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of</span>
  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
  the scope of this License.
  
<span class="line-modified">!   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public</span>
<span class="line-modified">! License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do</span>
<span class="line-modified">! this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so</span>
<span class="line-modified">! that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,</span>
<span class="line-modified">! instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the</span>
<span class="line-modified">! ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify</span>
<span class="line-modified">! that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in</span>
<span class="line-modified">! these notices.</span>
<span class="line-modified">! </span>
<span class="line-modified">!   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for</span>
<span class="line-modified">! that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all</span>
<span class="line-modified">! subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.</span>
<span class="line-modified">! </span>
<span class="line-modified">!   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of</span>
<span class="line-modified">! the Library into a program that is not a library.</span>
<span class="line-modified">! </span>
<span class="line-modified">!   4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or</span>
<span class="line-modified">! derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form</span>
<span class="line-modified">! under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany</span>
<span class="line-modified">! it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which</span>
<span class="line-modified">! must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a</span>
<span class="line-modified">! medium customarily used for software interchange.</span>
<span class="line-modified">! </span>
<span class="line-modified">!   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy</span>
<span class="line-modified">! from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the</span>
<span class="line-modified">! source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to</span>
<span class="line-modified">! distribute the source code, even though third parties are not</span>
  compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
<span class="line-added">+ </span>
<span class="line-added">+   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the</span>
<span class="line-added">+ Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or</span>
<span class="line-added">+ linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such a</span>
<span class="line-added">+ work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and</span>
<span class="line-added">+ therefore falls outside the scope of this License.</span>
<span class="line-added">+ </span>
<span class="line-added">+   However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library</span>
<span class="line-added">+ creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it</span>
<span class="line-added">+ contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the</span>
<span class="line-added">+ library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.</span>
<span class="line-added">+ Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.</span>
<span class="line-added">+ </span>
<span class="line-added">+   When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file</span>
<span class="line-added">+ that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a</span>
<span class="line-added">+ derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.</span>
<span class="line-added">+ Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be</span>
<span class="line-added">+ linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The</span>
<span class="line-added">+ threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.</span>
<span class="line-added">+ </span>
<span class="line-added">+   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data</span>
<span class="line-added">+ structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline</span>
<span class="line-added">+ functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object</span>
<span class="line-added">+ file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative</span>
<span class="line-added">+ work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the</span>
<span class="line-added">+ Library will still fall under Section 6.)</span>
<span class="line-added">+ </span>
<span class="line-added">+   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may</span>
<span class="line-added">+ distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.</span>
<span class="line-added">+ Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,</span>
<span class="line-added">+ whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.</span>
<span class="line-added">+ </span>
<span class="line-added">+   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or</span>
<span class="line-added">+ link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a</span>
<span class="line-added">+ work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work</span>
<span class="line-added">+ under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit</span>
<span class="line-added">+ modification of the work for the customer&#39;s own use and reverse</span>
<span class="line-added">+ engineering for debugging such modifications.</span>
<span class="line-added">+ </span>
<span class="line-added">+   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the</span>
<span class="line-added">+ Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by</span>
<span class="line-added">+ this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work</span>
<span class="line-added">+ during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the</span>
<span class="line-added">+ copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference</span>
<span class="line-added">+ directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one</span>
<span class="line-added">+ of these things:</span>
<span class="line-added">+ </span>
<span class="line-added">+     a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding</span>
<span class="line-added">+     machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever</span>
<span class="line-added">+     changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under</span>
<span class="line-added">+     Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked</span>
<span class="line-added">+     with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that</span>
<span class="line-added">+     uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the</span>
<span class="line-added">+     user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified</span>
<span class="line-added">+     executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood</span>
<span class="line-added">+     that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the</span>
<span class="line-added">+     Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application</span>
<span class="line-added">+     to use the modified definitions.)</span>
<span class="line-added">+ </span>
<span class="line-added">+     b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at</span>
<span class="line-added">+     least three years, to give the same user the materials</span>
<span class="line-added">+     specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more</span>
<span class="line-added">+     than the cost of performing this distribution.</span>
<span class="line-added">+ </span>
<span class="line-added">+     c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy</span>
<span class="line-added">+     from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above</span>
<span class="line-added">+     specified materials from the same place.</span>
<span class="line-added">+ </span>
<span class="line-added">+     d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these</span>
<span class="line-added">+     materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.</span>
<span class="line-added">+ </span>
<span class="line-added">+   For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the</span>
<span class="line-added">+ Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for</span>
<span class="line-added">+ reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,</span>
<span class="line-added">+ the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally</span>
<span class="line-added">+ distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major</span>
<span class="line-added">+ components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on</span>
<span class="line-added">+ which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies</span>
<span class="line-added">+ the executable.</span>
<span class="line-added">+ </span>
<span class="line-added">+   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license</span>
<span class="line-added">+ restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally</span>
<span class="line-added">+ accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot</span>
<span class="line-added">+ use both them and the Library together in an executable that you</span>
<span class="line-added">+ distribute.</span>
  
<span class="line-modified">!   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the</span>
<span class="line-modified">! Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library</span>
<span class="line-modified">! facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined</span>
<span class="line-modified">! library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on</span>
<span class="line-modified">! the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise</span>
<span class="line-modified">! permitted, and provided that you do these two things:</span>
<span class="line-modified">! </span>
<span class="line-modified">!     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work</span>
<span class="line-modified">!     based on the Library, uncombined with any other library</span>
<span class="line-added">+     facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the</span>
<span class="line-added">+     Sections above.</span>
<span class="line-added">+ </span>
<span class="line-added">+     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact</span>
<span class="line-added">+     that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining</span>
<span class="line-added">+     where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</span>
<span class="line-added">+ </span>
<span class="line-added">+   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute</span>
<span class="line-added">+ the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any</span>
<span class="line-added">+ attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or</span>
<span class="line-added">+ distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your</span>
<span class="line-added">+ rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,</span>
<span class="line-added">+ or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses</span>
<span class="line-added">+ terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</span>
<span class="line-added">+ </span>
<span class="line-added">+   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not</span>
  signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<span class="line-modified">! distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are</span>
  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
<span class="line-modified">! modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the</span>
<span class="line-modified">! Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and</span>
  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
<span class="line-modified">! the Library or works based on it.</span>
  
<span class="line-modified">!   10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the</span>
<span class="line-modified">! Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the</span>
<span class="line-modified">! original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library</span>
<span class="line-modified">! subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further</span>
  restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.
  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
  this License.
<span class="line-modified">! </span>
<span class="line-modified">!   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent</span>
  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
  excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
<span class="line-modified">! may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent</span>
<span class="line-modified">! license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by</span>
  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
<span class="line-modified">! refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.</span>
  
<span class="line-modified">! If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any</span>
<span class="line-modified">! particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,</span>
<span class="line-modified">! and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.</span>
  
  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<span class="line-modified">! integrity of the free software distribution system which is</span>
  implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
  to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
  impose that choice.
  
  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
  be a consequence of the rest of this License.
<span class="line-modified">! </span>
<span class="line-modified">!   12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in</span>
  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<span class="line-modified">! original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add</span>
<span class="line-modified">! an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,</span>
<span class="line-modified">! so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus</span>
<span class="line-modified">! excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if</span>

  		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
  
<span class="line-modified">!      Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries</span>
  
<span class="line-modified">!   If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest</span>
<span class="line-modified">! possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that</span>
<span class="line-modified">! everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting</span>
<span class="line-added">+ redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the</span>
<span class="line-added">+ ordinary General Public License).</span>
  
<span class="line-modified">!   To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is</span>
<span class="line-modified">! safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively</span>
<span class="line-modified">! convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the</span>
<span class="line-modified">! &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</span>
  
<span class="line-modified">!     &lt;one line to give the library&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;</span>
<span class="line-modified">!     Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;</span>
  
<span class="line-modified">!     This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or</span>
<span class="line-modified">!     modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public</span>
<span class="line-modified">!     License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either</span>
<span class="line-modified">!     version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.</span>
  
<span class="line-modified">!     This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,</span>
      but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<span class="line-modified">!     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU</span>
<span class="line-modified">!     Library General Public License for more details.</span>
  
<span class="line-added">+     You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public</span>
<span class="line-added">+     License along with this library; if not, write to the Free</span>
<span class="line-added">+     Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA.</span>
  
  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
  
  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<span class="line-modified">! school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library, if</span>
  necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
  
<span class="line-modified">!   Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the</span>
<span class="line-modified">!   library `Frob&#39; (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.</span>
  
<span class="line-modified">!   &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990</span>
    Ty Coon, President of Vice
  
<span class="line-modified">! That&#39;s all there is to it!</span>

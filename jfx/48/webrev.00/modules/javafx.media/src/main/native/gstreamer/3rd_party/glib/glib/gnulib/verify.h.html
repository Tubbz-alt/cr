 51 /* Each of these macros verifies that its argument R is nonzero.  To
 52    be portable, R should be an integer constant expression.  Unlike
 53    assert (R), there is no run-time overhead.
 54 
 55    If _Static_assert works, verify (R) uses it directly.  Similarly,
 56    _GL_VERIFY_TRUE works by packaging a _Static_assert inside a struct
 57    that is an operand of sizeof.
 58 
 59    The code below uses several ideas for C++ compilers, and for C
 60    compilers that do not support _Static_assert:
 61 
 62    * The first step is ((R) ? 1 : -1).  Given an expression R, of
 63      integral or boolean or floating-point type, this yields an
 64      expression of integral type, whose value is later verified to be
 65      constant and nonnegative.
 66 
 67    * Next this expression W is wrapped in a type
 68      struct _gl_verify_type {
 69        unsigned int _gl_verify_error_if_negative: W;
 70      }.
 71      If W is negative, this yields a compile-time error.  No compiler can
 72      deal with a bit-field of negative size.
 73 
 74      One might think that an array size check would have the same
 75      effect, that is, that the type struct { unsigned int dummy[W]; }
 76      would work as well.  However, inside a function, some compilers
 77      (such as C++ compilers and GNU C) allow local parameters and
 78      variables inside array size expressions.  With these compilers,
 79      an array size check would not properly diagnose this misuse of
 80      the verify macro:
 81 
 82        void function (int n) { verify (n &lt; 0); }
 83 
 84    * For the verify macro, the struct _gl_verify_type will need to
 85      somehow be embedded into a declaration.  To be portable, this
 86      declaration must declare an object, a constant, a function, or a
 87      typedef name.  If the declared entity uses the type directly,
 88      such as in
 89 
 90        struct dummy {...};
 91        typedef struct {...} dummy;
 92        extern struct {...} *dummy;
 93        extern void dummy (struct {...} *);
 94        extern struct {...} *dummy (void);
 95 
 96      two uses of the verify macro would yield colliding declarations
 97      if the entity names are not disambiguated.  A workaround is to
 98      attach the current line number to the entity name:
 99 
100        #define _GL_CONCAT0(x, y) x##y
101        #define _GL_CONCAT(x, y) _GL_CONCAT0 (x, y)
102        extern struct {...} * _GL_CONCAT (dummy, __LINE__);
103 
104      But this has the problem that two invocations of verify from
105      within the same macro would collide, since the __LINE__ value
106      would be the same for both invocations.  (The GCC __COUNTER__
107      macro solves this problem, but is not portable.)
108 
109      A solution is to use the sizeof operator.  It yields a number,
110      getting rid of the identity of the type.  Declarations like
111 
112        extern int dummy [sizeof (struct {...})];
113        extern void dummy (int [sizeof (struct {...})]);
114        extern int (*dummy (void)) [sizeof (struct {...})];
115 
116      can be repeated.
117 
118    * Should the implementation use a named struct or an unnamed struct?
119      Which of the following alternatives can be used?
120 
121        extern int dummy [sizeof (struct {...})];
122        extern int dummy [sizeof (struct _gl_verify_type {...})];
123        extern void dummy (int [sizeof (struct {...})]);
124        extern void dummy (int [sizeof (struct _gl_verify_type {...})]);
125        extern int (*dummy (void)) [sizeof (struct {...})];
126        extern int (*dummy (void)) [sizeof (struct _gl_verify_type {...})];
127 
128      In the second and sixth case, the struct type is exported to the
129      outer scope; two such declarations therefore collide.  GCC warns
130      about the first, third, and fourth cases.  So the only remaining
131      possibility is the fifth case:
132 
133        extern int (*dummy (void)) [sizeof (struct {...})];
134 
135    * GCC warns about duplicate declarations of the dummy function if
136      -Wredundant-decls is used.  GCC 4.3 and later have a builtin
137      __COUNTER__ macro that can let us generate unique identifiers for
138      each dummy function, to suppress this warning.
139 
140    * This implementation exploits the fact that older versions of GCC,
141      which do not support _Static_assert, also do not warn about the
142      last declaration mentioned above.
143 
144    * GCC warns if -Wnested-externs is enabled and verify() is used
145      within a function body; but inside a function, you can always
146      arrange to use verify_expr() instead.
147 
148    * In C++, any struct definition inside sizeof is invalid.
149      Use a template type to work around the problem.  */

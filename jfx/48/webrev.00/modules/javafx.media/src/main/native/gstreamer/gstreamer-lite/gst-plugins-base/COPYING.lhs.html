  9 			    Preamble
 10 
 11   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
 12 freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
<a name="4" id="anc4"></a><span class="line-modified"> 13 License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 14 software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 15 General Public License applies to most of the Free Software</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 16 Foundation&#39;s software and to any other program whose authors commit to</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 17 using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 18 the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 19 your programs, too.</span>
 20 
 21   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
 22 price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
 23 have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
 24 this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
 25 if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
 26 in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
 27 
 28   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
 29 anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
<a name="5" id="anc5"></a><span class="line-modified"> 30 These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 31 distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 32 </span>
<span class="line-modified"> 33   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 34 gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 35 you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 36 source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 37 rights.</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 38 </span>
<span class="line-modified"> 39   We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 40 (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 41 distribute and/or modify the software.</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 42 </span>
<span class="line-modified"> 43   Also, for each author&#39;s protection and ours, we want to make certain</span>


 44 that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
<a name="6" id="anc6"></a><span class="line-modified"> 45 software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 46 want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 47 that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 48 authors&#39; reputations.</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 49 </span>
 50   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
<a name="7" id="anc7"></a><span class="line-modified"> 51 patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 52 program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 53 program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 54 patent must be licensed for everyone&#39;s free use or not licensed at all.</span>

 56   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<a name="8" id="anc8"></a><span class="line-modified"> 57 modification follow.</span>






 58 
<a name="9" id="anc9"></a><span class="line-modified"> 59 		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</span>
 60    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
 61 
<a name="10" id="anc10"></a><span class="line-modified"> 62   0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 63 a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 64 under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;, below,</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 65 refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot;</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 66 means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 67 that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 68 either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 69 language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 70 the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 71 </span>
<span class="line-modified"> 72 Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not</span>














 73 covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
<a name="11" id="anc11"></a><span class="line-modified"> 74 running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 75 is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 76 Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 77 Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 78 </span>
<span class="line-modified"> 79   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 80 source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 81 conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 82 copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 83 notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 84 and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 85 along with the Program.</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 86 </span>
<span class="line-modified"> 87 You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 88 you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 89 </span>
<span class="line-modified"> 90   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 91 of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and</span>


 92 distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
 93 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
 94 
<a name="12" id="anc12"></a><span class="line-modified"> 95     a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices</span>


 96     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
 97 
<a name="13" id="anc13"></a><span class="line-modified"> 98     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 99     whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any</span>
<span class="line-modified">100     part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third</span>
<span class="line-modified">101     parties under the terms of this License.</span>
<span class="line-modified">102 </span>
<span class="line-modified">103     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively</span>
<span class="line-modified">104     when run, you must cause it, when started running for such</span>
<span class="line-modified">105     interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an</span>
<span class="line-modified">106     announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a</span>
<span class="line-modified">107     notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide</span>
<span class="line-modified">108     a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under</span>
<span class="line-modified">109     these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this</span>
<span class="line-modified">110     License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but</span>
<span class="line-modified">111     does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on</span>
<span class="line-modified">112     the Program is not required to print an announcement.)</span>
<span class="line-modified">113 </span>


114 These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
<a name="14" id="anc14"></a><span class="line-modified">115 identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,</span>
116 and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
117 themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
118 sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
119 distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
<a name="15" id="anc15"></a><span class="line-modified">120 on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of</span>
121 this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
<a name="16" id="anc16"></a><span class="line-modified">122 entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</span>

123 
124 Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
125 your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
126 exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<a name="17" id="anc17"></a><span class="line-modified">127 collective works based on the Program.</span>
128 
<a name="18" id="anc18"></a><span class="line-modified">129 In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program</span>
<span class="line-modified">130 with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of</span>
131 a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
132 the scope of this License.
133 
<a name="19" id="anc19"></a><span class="line-modified">134   3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,</span>
<span class="line-modified">135 under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of</span>
<span class="line-modified">136 Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:</span>
<span class="line-modified">137 </span>
<span class="line-modified">138     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable</span>
<span class="line-modified">139     source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections</span>
<span class="line-modified">140     1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</span>
<span class="line-modified">141 </span>
<span class="line-modified">142     b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three</span>
<span class="line-modified">143     years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your</span>
<span class="line-modified">144     cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete</span>
<span class="line-modified">145     machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be</span>
<span class="line-modified">146     distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium</span>
<span class="line-modified">147     customarily used for software interchange; or,</span>
<span class="line-modified">148 </span>
<span class="line-modified">149     c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer</span>
<span class="line-modified">150     to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is</span>
<span class="line-modified">151     allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you</span>
<span class="line-modified">152     received the program in object code or executable form with such</span>
<span class="line-modified">153     an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)</span>
<span class="line-modified">154 </span>
<span class="line-modified">155 The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for</span>
<span class="line-modified">156 making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source</span>
<span class="line-modified">157 code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any</span>
<span class="line-modified">158 associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to</span>
<span class="line-modified">159 control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a</span>
<span class="line-modified">160 special exception, the source code distributed need not include</span>
<span class="line-removed">161 anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary</span>
<span class="line-removed">162 form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the</span>
<span class="line-removed">163 operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component</span>
<span class="line-removed">164 itself accompanies the executable.</span>
<span class="line-removed">165 </span>
<span class="line-removed">166 If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering</span>
<span class="line-removed">167 access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent</span>
<span class="line-removed">168 access to copy the source code from the same place counts as</span>
<span class="line-removed">169 distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not</span>
170 compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

171 
<a name="21" id="anc21"></a><span class="line-modified">172   4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program</span>
<span class="line-modified">173 except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt</span>
<span class="line-modified">174 otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is</span>
<span class="line-modified">175 void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.</span>
<span class="line-modified">176 However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under</span>
<span class="line-modified">177 this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such</span>
<span class="line-modified">178 parties remain in full compliance.</span>
<span class="line-modified">179 </span>
<span class="line-modified">180   5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not</span>
















181 signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<a name="22" id="anc22"></a><span class="line-modified">182 distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are</span>
183 prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
<a name="23" id="anc23"></a><span class="line-modified">184 modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the</span>
<span class="line-modified">185 Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and</span>
186 all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
<a name="24" id="anc24"></a><span class="line-modified">187 the Program or works based on it.</span>
188 
<a name="25" id="anc25"></a><span class="line-modified">189   6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the</span>
<span class="line-modified">190 Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the</span>
<span class="line-modified">191 original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to</span>
<span class="line-modified">192 these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further</span>
193 restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.
194 You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
195 this License.
<a name="26" id="anc26"></a><span class="line-modified">196 </span>
<span class="line-modified">197   7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent</span>
198 infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
199 conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
200 otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
201 excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
202 distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
203 License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
<a name="27" id="anc27"></a><span class="line-modified">204 may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent</span>
<span class="line-modified">205 license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by</span>
206 all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
207 the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
<a name="28" id="anc28"></a><span class="line-modified">208 refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.</span>
209 
<a name="29" id="anc29"></a><span class="line-modified">210 If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under</span>
<span class="line-modified">211 any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to</span>
<span class="line-modified">212 apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other</span>
<span class="line-removed">213 circumstances.</span>
214 
215 It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
216 patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
217 such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<a name="30" id="anc30"></a><span class="line-modified">218 integrity of the free software distribution system, which is</span>
219 implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
220 generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
221 through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
222 system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
223 to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
224 impose that choice.
225 
226 This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
227 be a consequence of the rest of this License.
<a name="31" id="anc31"></a><span class="line-modified">228 </span>
<span class="line-modified">229   8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in</span>
230 certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<a name="32" id="anc32"></a><span class="line-modified">231 original copyright holder who places the Program under this License</span>
<span class="line-modified">232 may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding</span>
<span class="line-modified">233 those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among</span>
<span class="line-modified">234 countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates</span>
<span class="line-modified">235 the limitation as if written in the body of this License.</span>
<span class="line-modified">236 </span>
<span class="line-modified">237   9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions</span>
<span class="line-modified">238 of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will</span>
<span class="line-modified">239 be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to</span>
<span class="line-modified">240 address new problems or concerns.</span>
<span class="line-modified">241 </span>
<span class="line-modified">242 Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program</span>
<span class="line-modified">243 specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any</span>
<span class="line-modified">244 later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions</span>
<span class="line-modified">245 either of that version or of any later version published by the Free</span>
<span class="line-modified">246 Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of</span>
<span class="line-modified">247 this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software</span>
<span class="line-modified">248 Foundation.</span>
<span class="line-modified">249 </span>
<span class="line-modified">250   10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free</span>
<span class="line-modified">251 programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author</span>
<span class="line-modified">252 to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free</span>
<span class="line-modified">253 Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes</span>
<span class="line-modified">254 make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals</span>
<span class="line-modified">255 of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and</span>
<span class="line-modified">256 of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.</span>

257 
258 			    NO WARRANTY
259 
<a name="33" id="anc33"></a><span class="line-modified">260   11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY</span>
<span class="line-modified">261 FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN</span>
<span class="line-modified">262 OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES</span>
<span class="line-modified">263 PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED</span>
<span class="line-modified">264 OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF</span>
<span class="line-modified">265 MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS</span>
<span class="line-modified">266 TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE</span>
<span class="line-modified">267 PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,</span>
<span class="line-modified">268 REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</span>
<span class="line-modified">269 </span>
<span class="line-modified">270   12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING</span>
<span class="line-modified">271 WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR</span>
<span class="line-modified">272 REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,</span>
<span class="line-modified">273 INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING</span>
<span class="line-modified">274 OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED</span>
<span class="line-modified">275 TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY</span>
<span class="line-modified">276 YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER</span>
<span class="line-modified">277 PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE</span>
<span class="line-modified">278 POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</span>

<a name="35" id="anc35"></a><span class="line-modified">284   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest</span>

 30 /* Any definitions using GPollFD or GPollFunc are primarily
 31  * for Unix and not guaranteed to be the compatible on all
 32  * operating systems on which GLib runs. Right now, the
 33  * GLib does use these functions on Win32 as well, but interprets
 34  * them in a fairly different way than on Unix. If you use
 35  * these definitions, you are should be prepared to recode
 36  * for different operating systems.
 37  *
 38  * Note that on systems with a working poll(2), that function is used
 39  * in place of g_poll(). Thus g_poll() must have the same signature as
 40  * poll(), meaning GPollFD must have the same layout as struct pollfd.
 41  *
 42  * On Win32, the fd in a GPollFD should be Win32 HANDLE (*not* a file
 43  * descriptor as provided by the C runtime) that can be used by
 44  * MsgWaitForMultipleObjects. This does *not* include file handles
 45  * from CreateFile, SOCKETs, nor pipe handles. (But you can use
 46  * WSAEventSelect to signal events when a SOCKET is readable).
 47  *
 48  * On Win32, fd can also be the special value G_WIN32_MSG_HANDLE to
 49  * indicate polling for messages.
 50  *
 51  * But note that G_WIN32_MSG_HANDLE GPollFDs should not be used by GDK
 52  * (GTK) programs, as GDK itself wants to read messages and convert them
 53  * to GDK events.
 54  *
 55  * So, unless you really know what you are doing, it&#39;s best not to try
 56  * to use the main loop polling stuff for your own needs on
 57  * Windows.

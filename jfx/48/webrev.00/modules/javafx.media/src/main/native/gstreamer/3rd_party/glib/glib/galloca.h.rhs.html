 61  * g_alloca:
 62  * @size: number of bytes to allocate.
 63  *
 64  * Allocates @size bytes on the stack; these bytes will be freed when the current
 65  * stack frame is cleaned up. This macro essentially just wraps the alloca()
 66  * function present on most UNIX variants.
 67  * Thus it provides the same advantages and pitfalls as alloca():
 68  *
 69  * - alloca() is very fast, as on most systems it&#39;s implemented by just adjusting
 70  *   the stack pointer register.
 71  *
 72  * - It doesn&#39;t cause any memory fragmentation, within its scope, separate alloca()
 73  *   blocks just build up and are released together at function end.
 74  *
 75  * - Allocation sizes have to fit into the current stack frame. For instance in a
 76  *   threaded environment on Linux, the per-thread stack size is limited to 2 Megabytes,
 77  *   so be sparse with alloca() uses.
 78  *
 79  * - Allocation failure due to insufficient stack space is not indicated with a %NULL
 80  *   return like e.g. with malloc(). Instead, most systems probably handle it the same
 81  *   way as out of stack space situations from infinite function recursion, i.e.
 82  *   with a segmentation fault.
 83  *
 84  * - Special care has to be taken when mixing alloca() with GNU C variable sized arrays.
 85  *   Stack space allocated with alloca() in the same scope as a variable sized array
 86  *   will be freed together with the variable sized array upon exit of that scope, and
 87  *   not upon exit of the enclosing function scope.
 88  *
 89  * Returns: space for @size bytes, allocated on the stack

  6  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
  7  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
  8 
  9 [This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is
 10  numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]
 11 
 12 			    Preamble
 13 
 14   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
 15 freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
 16 Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
 17 free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
 18 
 19   This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some
 20 specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any
 21 other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for
 22 your libraries, too.
 23 
 24   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
 25 price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
 26 have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
 27 this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
 28 if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
 29 in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
 30 
 31   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
 32 anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
 33 These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
 34 you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.
 35 
 36   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
 37 or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
 38 you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
 39 code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide
 40 complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them
 41 with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling
 42 it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
 43 
 44   Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright
 45 the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
 46 permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
 47 
 48   Also, for each distributor&#39;s protection, we want to make certain
 49 that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
 50 library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we
 51 want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original
 52 version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on
 53 the original authors&#39; reputations.
 54 
 55   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
 56 patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free
 57 software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect
 58 transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,
 59 we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone&#39;s
 60 free use or not licensed at all.
 61 
 62   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary
 63 GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This
 64 license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain
 65 designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary
 66 one; be sure to read it in full, and don&#39;t assume that anything in it is
 67 the same as in the ordinary license.
 68 
 69   The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that
 70 they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a
 71 program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without
 72 changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is
 73 analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in
 74 a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a
 75 derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License
 76 treats it as such.
 77 
 78   Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General
 79 Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software
 80 sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We
 81 concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.
 82 
 83   However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the
 84 users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the
 85 libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to
 86 permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while
 87 preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free
 88 libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve
 89 this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards
 90 changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this
 91 will lead to faster development of free libraries.
 92 
 93   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
 94 modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
 95 &quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.  The
 96 former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only
 97 works together with the library.
 98 
 99   Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary
100 General Public License rather than by this special one.
101 
102 		  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
103    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
104 
105   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which
106 contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
107 party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library
108 General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).  Each licensee is
109 addressed as &quot;you&quot;.
110 
111   A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data
112 prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
113 (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
114 
115   The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work
116 which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based on the
117 Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under
118 copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
119 portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
120 straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
121 included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)
122 
123   &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for
124 making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
125 all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
126 interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
127 and installation of the library.
128 
129   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
130 covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
131 running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
132 such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
133 on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
134 writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
135 and what the program that uses the Library does.
136   
137   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&#39;s
138 complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
139 you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
140 appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
141 all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
142 warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
143 Library.
144 
145   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
146 and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
147 fee.
148 
149   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
150 of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
151 distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
152 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
153 
154     a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
155 
156     b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
157     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
158 
159     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
160     charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
161 
162     d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
163     table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
164     the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
165     is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
166     in the event an application does not supply such function or
167     table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
168     its purpose remains meaningful.
169 
170     (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
171     a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
172     application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
173     application-supplied function or table used by this function must
174     be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
175     root function must still compute square roots.)
176 
177 These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
178 identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
179 and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
180 themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
181 sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
182 distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
183 on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
184 this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
185 entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
186 it.
187 
188 Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
189 your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
190 exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
191 collective works based on the Library.
192 
193 In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
194 with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
195 a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
196 the scope of this License.
197 
198   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
199 License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
200 this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
201 that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
202 instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
203 ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
204 that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
205 these notices.
206 
207   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
208 that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
209 subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
210 
211   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
212 the Library into a program that is not a library.
213 
214   4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
215 derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
216 under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
217 it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
218 must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
219 medium customarily used for software interchange.
220 
221   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
222 from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
223 source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
224 distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
225 compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
226 
227   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
228 Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
229 linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such a
230 work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
231 therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
232 
233   However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library
234 creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
235 contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the
236 library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
237 Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
238 
239   When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file
240 that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
241 derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
242 Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
243 linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
244 threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
245 
246   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
247 structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
248 functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
249 file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
250 work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
251 Library will still fall under Section 6.)
252 
253   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
254 distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
255 Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
256 whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
257 
258   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or
259 link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a
260 work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
261 under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
262 modification of the work for the customer&#39;s own use and reverse
263 engineering for debugging such modifications.
264 
265   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
266 Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
267 this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
268 during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
269 copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
270 directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
271 of these things:
272 
273     a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
274     machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
275     changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
276     Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
277     with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that
278     uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the
279     user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
280     executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
281     that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
282     Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
283     to use the modified definitions.)
284 
285     b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
286     least three years, to give the same user the materials
287     specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
288     than the cost of performing this distribution.
289 
290     c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
291     from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
292     specified materials from the same place.
293 
294     d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
295     materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
296 
297   For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the
298 Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for
299 reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
300 the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
301 distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
302 components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
303 which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
304 the executable.
305 
306   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
307 restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
308 accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
309 use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
310 distribute.
311 
312   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
313 Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
314 facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
315 library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
316 the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
317 permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
318 
319     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
320     based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
321     facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
322     Sections above.
323 
324     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
325     that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
326     where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
327 
328   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
329 the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
330 attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
331 distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
332 rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
333 or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
334 terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
335 
336   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
337 signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
338 distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
339 prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
340 modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
341 Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
342 all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
343 the Library or works based on it.
344 
345   10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
346 Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
347 original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
348 subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
349 restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.
350 You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
351 this License.
352 
353   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
354 infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
355 conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
356 otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
357 excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
358 distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
359 License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
360 may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
361 license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
362 all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
363 the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
364 refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
365 
366 If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
367 particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
368 and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
369 
370 It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
371 patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
372 such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
373 integrity of the free software distribution system which is
374 implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
375 generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
376 through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
377 system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
378 to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
379 impose that choice.
380 
381 This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
382 be a consequence of the rest of this License.
383 
384   12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
385 certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
386 original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
387 an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
388 so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
389 excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
390 written in the body of this License.
391 
392   13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
393 versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.
394 Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
395 but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
396 
397 Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
398 specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
399 &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and
400 conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
401 the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
402 license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
403 the Free Software Foundation.
404 
405   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
406 programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
407 write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
408 copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
409 Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
410 decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
411 of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
412 and reuse of software generally.
413 
414 			    NO WARRANTY
415 
416   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
417 WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
418 EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
419 OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
420 KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
421 IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
422 PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
423 LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
424 THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
425 
426   16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
427 WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
428 AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
429 FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
430 CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
431 LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
432 RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
433 FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
434 SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
435 DAMAGES.
436 
437 		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
438 
439      Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
440 
441   If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
442 possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
443 everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
444 redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
445 ordinary General Public License).
446 
447   To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
448 safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
449 convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
450 &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
451 
452     &lt;one line to give the library&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
453     Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;
454 
455     This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
456     modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public
457     License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
458     version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
459 
460     This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
461     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
462     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
463     Library General Public License for more details.

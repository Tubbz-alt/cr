225  #
226  #  A large portion of the dictionary entries
227  #  originate from ICOT Free Software.  The following conditions for ICOT
228  #  Free Software applies to the current dictionary as well.
229  #
230  #  Each User may also freely distribute the Program, whether in its
231  #  original form or modified, to any third party or parties, PROVIDED
232  #  that the provisions of Section 3 (&quot;NO WARRANTY&quot;) will ALWAYS appear
233  #  on, or be attached to, the Program, which is distributed substantially
234  #  in the same form as set out herein and that such intended
235  #  distribution, if actually made, will neither violate or otherwise
236  #  contravene any of the laws and regulations of the countries having
237  #  jurisdiction over the User or the intended distribution itself.
238  #
239  #  NO WARRANTY
240  #
241  #  The program was produced on an experimental basis in the course of the
242  #  research and development conducted during the project and is provided
243  #  to users as so produced on an experimental basis.  Accordingly, the
244  #  program is provided without any warranty whatsoever, whether express,
245  #  implied, statutory or otherwise.  The term &quot;warranty&quot; used herein
246  #  includes, but is not limited to, any warranty of the quality,
247  #  performance, merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose of
248  #  the program and the nonexistence of any infringement or violation of
249  #  any right of any third party.
250  #
251  #  Each user of the program will agree and understand, and be deemed to
252  #  have agreed and understood, that there is no warranty whatsoever for
253  #  the program and, accordingly, the entire risk arising from or
254  #  otherwise connected with the program is assumed by the user.
255  #
256  #  Therefore, neither ICOT, the copyright holder, or any other
257  #  organization that participated in or was otherwise related to the
258  #  development of the program and their respective officials, directors,
259  #  officers and other employees shall be held liable for any and all
260  #  damages, including, without limitation, general, special, incidental
261  #  and consequential damages, arising out of or otherwise in connection
262  #  with the use or inability to use the program or any product, material
263  #  or result produced or otherwise obtained by using the program,
264  #  regardless of whether they have been advised of, or otherwise had
265  #  knowledge of, the possibility of such damages at any time during the
266  #  project or thereafter.  Each user will be deemed to have agreed to the
267  #  foregoing by his or her commencement of use of the program.  The term
268  #  &quot;use&quot; as used herein includes, but is not limited to, the use,
269  #  modification, copying and distribution of the program and the
270  #  production of secondary products from the program.
271  #
272  #  In the case where the program, whether in its original form or
273  #  modified, was distributed or delivered to or received by a user from
274  #  any person, organization or entity other than ICOT, unless it makes or
275  #  grants independently of ICOT any specific warranty to the user in
276  #  writing, such person, organization or entity, will also be exempted
277  #  from and not be held liable to the user for any such damages as noted
278  #  above as far as the program is concerned.

364 5. Time Zone Database
365 
366   ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone
367 Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database
368 is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone
369 Database section 7.
370 
371  # 7.  Database Ownership
372  #
373  #    The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF
374  #    document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work
375  #    that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the
376  #    public domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do
377  #    not apply to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make
378  #    to it.  Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ
379  #    Database, the organization that is providing the IANA
380  #    Considerations defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of
381  #    understanding with the IETF, currently ICANN, may act in accordance
382  #    with all competent court orders.  No ownership claims will be made
383  #    by ICANN or the IETF Trust on the database or the code.  Any person
384  #    making a contribution to the database or code waives all rights to
385  #    future claims in that contribution or in the TZ Database.

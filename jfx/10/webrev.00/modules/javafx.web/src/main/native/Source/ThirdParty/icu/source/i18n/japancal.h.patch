  * In modern times, eras have started on January 8, 1868 AD, Gregorian (Meiji),
  * July 30, 1912 (Taisho), December 25, 1926 (Showa), and January 7, 1989 (Heisei).  Constants
  * for these eras, suitable for use in the <code>UCAL_ERA</code> field, are provided
  * in this class.  Note that the <em>number</em> used for each era is more or
- * less arbitrary.  Currently, the era starting in 1053 AD is era #0; however this
- * may change in the future as we add more historical data.  Use the predefined
- * constants rather than using actual, absolute numbers.

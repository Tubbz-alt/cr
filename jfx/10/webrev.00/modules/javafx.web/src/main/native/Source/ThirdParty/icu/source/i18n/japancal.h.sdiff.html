 33  * &lt;code&gt;JapaneseCalendar&lt;/code&gt; is a subclass of &lt;code&gt;GregorianCalendar&lt;/code&gt;
 34  * that numbers years and eras based on the reigns of the Japanese emperors.
 35  * The Japanese calendar is identical to the Gregorian calendar in all respects
 36  * except for the year and era.  The ascension of each  emperor to the throne
 37  * begins a new era, and the years of that era are numbered starting with the
 38  * year of ascension as year 1.
 39  * &lt;p&gt;
 40  * Note that in the year of an imperial ascension, there are two possible sets
 41  * of year and era values: that for the old era and for the new.  For example, a
 42  * new era began on January 7, 1989 AD.  Strictly speaking, the first six days
 43  * of that year were in the Showa era, e.g. &quot;January 6, 64 Showa&quot;, while the rest
 44  * of the year was in the Heisei era, e.g. &quot;January 7, 1 Heisei&quot;.  This class
 45  * handles this distinction correctly when computing dates.  However, in lenient
 46  * mode either form of date is acceptable as input.
 47  * &lt;p&gt;
 48  * In modern times, eras have started on January 8, 1868 AD, Gregorian (Meiji),
 49  * July 30, 1912 (Taisho), December 25, 1926 (Showa), and January 7, 1989 (Heisei).  Constants
 50  * for these eras, suitable for use in the &lt;code&gt;UCAL_ERA&lt;/code&gt; field, are provided
 51  * in this class.  Note that the &lt;em&gt;number&lt;/em&gt; used for each era is more or
<span class="line-modified"> 52  * less arbitrary.  Currently, the era starting in 1053 AD is era #0; however this</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 53  * may change in the future as we add more historical data.  Use the predefined</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 54  * constants rather than using actual, absolute numbers.</span>

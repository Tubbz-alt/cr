  98  * this common case, fills of shapes with straight line edges tend to be
  99  * crisp since they line up with the cracks between pixels that fall on
 100  * integer device coordinates and thus tend to naturally cover entire pixels.

 102  * On the other hand, stroking those same shapes can often lead to fuzzy
 103  * outlines because the default stroking attributes specify both that the
 104  * default stroke width is 1.0 coordinates which often maps to exactly 1
 105  * device pixel and also that the stroke should straddle the border of the
 106  * shape, falling half on either side of the border.
 107  * Since the borders in many common shapes tend to fall directly on integer
 108  * coordinates and those integer coordinates often map precisely to integer
 109  * device locations, the borders tend to result in 50% coverage over the
 110  * pixel rows and columns on either side of the border of the shape rather
 111  * than 100% coverage on one or the other.  Thus, fills may typically be
 112  * crisp, but strokes are often fuzzy.

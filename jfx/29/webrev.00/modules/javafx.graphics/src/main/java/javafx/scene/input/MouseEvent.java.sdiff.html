  45  * The mouse (pointer&#39;s) location is available relative to several

<span class="line-modified">  52  * &lt;h3&gt;Dragging gestures&lt;/h3&gt;</span>
  53  * &lt;p&gt;
  54  * There are three types of dragging gestures. They are all initiated by
  55  * a mouse press event and terminated as a result of a mouse released
  56  * event, the source node decides which gesture will take place.
  57  * &lt;p&gt;
  58  * The simple press-drag-release gesture is default. It&#39;s best used to allow
  59  * changing size of a shape, dragging it around and so on. Whole
  60  * press-drag-release gesture is delivered to one node. When mouse
  61  * button is pressed, the top-most node is picked and all subsequent
  62  * mouse events are delivered to the same node until the button is released.
  63  * If a mouse clicked event is generated from these events, it is still
  64  * delivered to the same node.
  65  * &lt;p&gt;
  66  * During simple press-drag-release gesture, the other nodes are not involved
  67  * and don&#39;t get any events. If these nodes need to be involved in the gesture,
  68  * full press-drag-release gesture has to be activated. This gesture is
  69  * best used for connecting nodes by &quot;wires&quot;, dragging nodes to other nodes etc.
  70  * This gesture type is more closely described at
  71  * {@link javafx.scene.input.MouseDragEvent MouseDragEvent} which contains
  72  * the events delivered to the gesture targets.
</pre>
<hr />
<pre>
  77  * at {@link javafx.scene.input.DragEvent DragEvent}.
  78  * &lt;p&gt;
  79  * In a short summary, simple press-drag-release gesture is activated
  80  * automatically when a mouse button is pressed and delivers all
  81  * {@code MouseEvent}s to the gesture source. When you start dragging,
  82  * eventually the {@code DRAG_DETECTED} event arrives. In its handler
  83  * you can either start full press-drag-release gesture by calling
  84  * {@code startFullDrag} method on a node or scene - the {@code MouseDragEvent}s
  85  * start to be delivered to gesture targets, or you can start drag and drop
  86  * gesture by calling {@code startDragAndDrop} method on a node or scene -
  87  * the system switches into the drag and drop mode and {@code DragEvent}s start
  88  * to be delivered instead of {@code MouseEvent}s. If you don&#39;t call any of
  89  * those methods, the simple press-drag-release gesture continues.
  90  * &lt;p&gt;
  91  * Note that dragging a finger over touch screen produces mouse dragging events,
  92  * but also scroll gesture events. If it means a conflict in an application
  93  * (the physical dragging action is handled by two different handlers), the
  94  * {@code isSynthesized()} method may be used to detect the problem and make the
  95  * dragging handlers behave accordingly.
  96  *
<span class="line-modified">  97  * &lt;h3&gt;Mouse enter/exit handling&lt;/h3&gt;</span>
  98  * &lt;p&gt;
  99  * When mouse enters a node, the node gets {@code MOUSE_ENTERED} event, when
 100  * it leaves, it gets {@code MOUSE_EXITED} event. These events are delivered
 101  * only to the entered/exited node and seemingly don&#39;t go through the
 102  * capturing/bubbling phases. This is the most common use-case.
 103  * &lt;p&gt;
 104  * When the capturing or bubbling is desired, there are
 105  * {@code MOUSE_ENTERED_TARGET}/{@code MOUSE_EXITED_TARGET} events. These events
 106  * go through capturing/bubbling phases normally. This means that parent may
 107  * receive the {@code MOUSE_ENTERED_TARGET} event when mouse entered
 108  * either the parent itself or some of its children. To distinguish between
 109  * these two cases event target can be tested on equality with the node.
 110  * &lt;p&gt;
 111  * These two types are closely connected:
 112  * {@code MOUSE_ENTERED}/{@code MOUSE_EXITED} are subtypes
 113  * of {@code MOUSE_ENTERED_TARGET}/{@code MOUSE_EXITED_TARGET}.
 114  * During capturing phase,
 115  * {@code MOUSE_ENTERED_TARGET} is delivered to the
 116  * parents. When the event is delivered to the event target (the node that
 117  * has actually been entered), its type is switched to
 118  * {@code MOUSE_ENTERED}. Then the type is switched back to
 119  * {@code MOUSE_ENTERED_TARGET} for the bubbling phase.
 120  * It&#39;s still one event just switching types, so if it&#39;s filtered or consumed,
 121  * it affects both event variants. Thanks to the subtype-relationship, a
 122  * {@code MOUSE_ENTERED_TARGET} event handler will receive the
 123  * {@code MOUSE_ENTERED} event on target.
 124  *
<span class="line-modified"> 125  * &lt;h3&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;</span>

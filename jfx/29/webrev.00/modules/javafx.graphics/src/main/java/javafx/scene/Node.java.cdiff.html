   * Each node in the scene graph can be given a unique {@link #idProperty id}. This id is
   * much like the &quot;id&quot; attribute of an HTML tag in that it is up to the designer
   * and developer to ensure that the {@code id} is unique within the scene graph.
   * A convenience function called {@link #lookup(String)} can be used to find
   * a node with a unique id within the scene graph, or within a subtree of the
   * scene graph. The id can also be used identify nodes for applying styles; see

   * coordinate system in which the {@code x} axis increases to the right and the

   * Most nodes tend to have only integer translations applied to them and
   * quite often they are defined using integer coordinates as well.  For
   * this common case, fills of shapes with straight line edges tend to be
   * crisp since they line up with the cracks between pixels that fall on
   * integer device coordinates and thus tend to naturally cover entire pixels.

33 &lt;title&gt;javafx.beans.binding&lt;/title&gt;
34 &lt;/head&gt;
35 &lt;body&gt;
36     &lt;p&gt;Provides classes that create and operate on a {@link Binding Binding}
37         that calculates a value that depends on one or more sources.&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="1" id="anc1"></a><span class="line-modified">38 	&lt;h2&gt;Characteristics of Bindings&lt;/h2&gt;</span>
39 	&lt;p&gt;Bindings are assembled from one or more sources, usually called
40 		their dependencies. A binding observes its dependencies for changes
41 		and updates its own value according to changes in the dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
42 	&lt;p&gt;Almost all bindings defined in this library require
43 		implementations of {@link javafx.beans.Observable} for their
44 		dependencies. There are two types of implementations already provided,
45 		the properties in the package {@link javafx.beans.property} and the
46 		observable collections ({@link javafx.collections.ObservableList} and
47 		{@link javafx.collections.ObservableMap}). Bindings also implement
48 		{@code Observable} and can again serve as sources for other bindings
49 		allowing to construct very complex bindings from simple ones.&lt;/p&gt;
50 	&lt;p&gt;Bindings in our implementation are always calculated lazily.
51 		That means, if a dependency changes, the result of a binding is not
52 		immediately recalculated, but it is marked as invalid. Next time the
53 		value of an invalid binding is requested, it is recalculated.&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="2" id="anc2"></a><span class="line-modified">54 	&lt;h2&gt;High Level API and Low Level API&lt;/h2&gt;</span>
55 	&lt;p&gt;The Binding API is roughly divided in two parts, the High Level
56 		Binding API and the Low Level Binding API. The High Level Binding API
57 		allows to construct simple bindings in an easy to use fashion.
58 		Defining a binding with the High Level API should be straightforward,
59 		especially when used in an IDE that provides code completion.
60 		Unfortunately it has its limitation and at that point the Low Level
61 		API comes into play. Experienced Java developers can use the Low Level
62 		API to define bindings, if the functionality of the High Level API is
63 		not sufficient or to improve the performance. The main goals of the
64 		Low Level API are fast execution and small memory footprint.&lt;/p&gt;
65 	&lt;p&gt;Following is an example of how both APIs can be used. Assuming
66 		we have four instances of {@link
67 		javafx.beans.property.DoubleProperty} {@code a}, {@code b}, {@code
68 		c} , and {@code d}, we can define a binding that calculates {@code a*b
69 		+ c*d} with the High Level API for example like this:&lt;/p&gt;
70 	&lt;p&gt;{@code NumberBinding result = Bindings.add (a.multiply(b),
71 		c.multiply(d)); }&lt;/p&gt;
72 	&lt;p&gt;Defining the same binding using the Low Level API could be done
73 		like this:&lt;/p&gt;
74 	&lt;pre&gt;
75 &lt;code&gt;
76 DoubleBinding foo = new DoubleBinding() {
77 
78     {
79         super.bind(a, b, c, d);
80     }
81 
82     &amp;#x40;Override
83     protected double computeValue() {
84         return a.getValue() * b.getValue() + c.getValue() * d.getValue();
85     }
86 };
87 &lt;/code&gt;
88 &lt;/pre&gt;
89 &lt;/body&gt;
90 &lt;/html&gt;

  		allowing to construct very complex bindings from simple ones.&lt;/p&gt;
  	&lt;p&gt;Bindings in our implementation are always calculated lazily.
  		That means, if a dependency changes, the result of a binding is not
  		immediately recalculated, but it is marked as invalid. Next time the
  		value of an invalid binding is requested, it is recalculated.&lt;/p&gt;

  	&lt;p&gt;The Binding API is roughly divided in two parts, the High Level
  		Binding API and the Low Level Binding API. The High Level Binding API
  		allows to construct simple bindings in an easy to use fashion.
  		Defining a binding with the High Level API should be straightforward,
  		especially when used in an IDE that provides code completion.

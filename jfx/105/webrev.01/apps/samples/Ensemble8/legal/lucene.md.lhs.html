 48    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
 49 
 50    1. Definitions.
 51 
 52       &quot;License&quot; shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
 53       and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
 54 
 55       &quot;Licensor&quot; shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
 56       the copyright owner that is granting the License.
 57 
 58       &quot;Legal Entity&quot; shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
 59       other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
 60       control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
 61       &quot;control&quot; means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
 62       direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
 63       otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
 64       outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
 65 
 66       &quot;You&quot; (or &quot;Your&quot;) shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
 67       exercising permissions granted by this License.
 68 
 69       &quot;Source&quot; form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
 70       including but not limited to software source code, documentation
 71       source, and configuration files.
 72 
 73       &quot;Object&quot; form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
 74       transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
 75       not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
 76       and conversions to other media types.
 77 
 78       &quot;Work&quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
 79       Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
 80       copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
 81       (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
 82 
 83       &quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
 84       form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
 85       editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
 86       represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
 87       of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
 88       separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
 89       the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
 90 
 91       &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including
 92       the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
 93       to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
 94       submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
 95       or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
 96       the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &quot;submitted&quot;
 97       means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
 98       to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
 99       communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
100       and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
101       Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
102       excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
103       designated in writing by the copyright owner as &quot;Not a Contribution.&quot;
104 
105       &quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
106       on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
107       subsequently incorporated within the Work.
108 
109    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
110       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
111       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
112       copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
113       publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
114       Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
115 
116    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
117       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
118       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
119       (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
120       use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
121       where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
122       by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
123       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
124       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
125       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
126       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
127       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
128       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
129       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
130       as of the date such litigation is filed.
131 
132    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
133       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
134       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
135       meet the following conditions:
136 
137       (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
138           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
139 
140       (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
141           stating that You changed the files; and
142 
143       (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
144           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
145           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
146           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
147           the Derivative Works; and
148 
149       (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
150           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
151           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
152           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
153           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
154           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
155           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
156           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
157           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
158           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
159           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
160           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
161           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
162           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
163           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
164           as modifying the License.
165 
166       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
167       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
168       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
169       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
170       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
171       the conditions stated in this License.
172 
173    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
174       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
175       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
176       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
177       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
178       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
179       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
180 
181    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
182       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
183       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
184       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
185 
186    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
187       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
188       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
189       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
190       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
191       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
192       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
193       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
194       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
195 
196    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
197       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
198       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
199       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
200       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
201       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
202       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
203       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
204       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
205       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
206       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
207 
208    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
209       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
210       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
211       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
212       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
213       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
214       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
215       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
216       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
217       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
218 
219    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  2 
<a name="1" id="anc1"></a><span class="line-added">  3 The goal of Project Skara is to investigate alternative SCM and code review</span>
<span class="line-added">  4 options for the OpenJDK source code, including options based upon Git rather than</span>
<span class="line-added">  5 Mercurial, and including options hosted by third parties.</span>
<span class="line-added">  6 </span>
  7 This repository contains tooling for working with OpenJDK projects and
  8 their repositories. The following CLI tools are available as part of this
  9 repository:
 10 
 11 - git-jcheck - a backwards compatible Git port of [jcheck](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jcheck/)
 12 - git-webrev - a backwards compatible Git port of [webrev](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/webrev/)
 13 - git-defpath - a backwards compatible Git port of [defpath](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/defpath/)
 14 - git-fork - fork a project on an external Git source code hosting provider to your personal space and optionally clone it
 15 - git-pr - interact with pull requests for a project on an external Git source code hosting provider
 16 - git-info - show OpenJDK information about commits, e.g. issue links, authors, contributors, etc.
 17 - git-token - interact with a Git credential manager for handling personal access tokens
 18 - git-translate - translate between [Mercurial](https://mercurial-scm.org/)
 19 and [Git](https://git-scm.com/) hashes
 20 - git-skara - learn about and update the Skara CLI tools
 21 
 22 There are also CLI tools available for importing OpenJDK
 23 [Mercurial](https://mercurial-scm.org/) repositories into
 24 [Git](https://git-scm.com/) repositories and vice versa:
 25 
 26 - git-openjdk-import
 27 - git-verify-import
 28 - hg-openjdk-import
 29 
 30 The following server-side tools (so called &quot;bots&quot;) for interacting with
 31 external Git source code hosting providers are available:
 32 
 33 - hgbridge - continously convert Mercurial repositories to git
 34 - mlbridge - bridge messages between mailing lists and pull requests
 35 - notify - send email notifications when repositories are updated
 36 - pr - add OpenJDK workflow support for pull requests
 37 - submit - example pull request test runner
 38 
 39 ## Building
 40 
 41 [JDK 12](http://jdk.java.net/12/) or later and [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)
 42 5.2.1 or later is required for building. To build the project on macOS or
 43 GNU/Linux, just run the following command from the source tree root:
 44 
 45 ```bash
 46 $ sh gradlew
 47 ```
 48 
 49 To build the project on Windows, run the following command from the source tree root:
 50 
 51 ```bat
 52 &gt; gradlew
 53 ```
 54 
 55 The extracted jlinked image will end up in the `build` directory in the source
 56 tree root.
 57 
 58 It is also supported to cross-jlink jimages to GNU/Linux, macOS and/or Windows from
 59 any of the aforementioned operating systems. To build all applicable jimages
 60 (including the server-side tooling), run the following command from the
 61 source tree root:
 62 
 63 ```bash
 64 sh gradlew images
 65 ```
 66 
 67 ## Installing
 68 
 69 To install the Skara tools, include the `skara.gitconfig` Git configuration
 70 file in your user-level Git configuration file. On macOS or
 71 GNU/Linux:
 72 
 73 ```bash
 74 $ git config --global include.path &quot;$PWD/skara.gitconfig&quot;
 75 ```
 76 
 77 On Windows:
 78 
 79 ```bat
 80 &gt; git config --global include.path &quot;%CD%/skara.gitconfig&quot;
 81 ```
 82 
 83 To check that everything works as expected, run the command `git skara help`.
 84 
 85 ## Testing
 86 
 87 [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/) 5.3.1 or later is required to run the unit
 88 tests. To run the tests, execute following command from the source tree root:
 89 
 90 ```bash
 91 $ sh gradlew test
 92 ```
 93 
 94 The tests expect [Git](https://git-scm.com/) version 2.19.1 or later and
 95 [Mercurial](https://mercurial-scm.org/) 4.7.1 or later to be installed on
 96 your system.
 97 
 98 This repository also contains a Dockerfile, `test.dockerfile`, that allows
 99 for running the tests in a reproducible way with the proper dependencies
100 configured. To run the tests in this way, run the following command from the
101 source tree root:
102 
103 ```bash
104 $ sh gradlew reproduce
105 ```

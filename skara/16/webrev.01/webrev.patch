 # OpenJDK Project Skara
 
+The goal of Project Skara is to investigate alternative SCM and code review
+options for the JDK source code, including options based upon Git rather than
+Mercurial, and including options hosted by third parties.
+
 This repository contains tooling for working with OpenJDK projects and
 their repositories. The following CLI tools are available as part of this
 repository:
 
 - git-jcheck - a backwards compatible Git port of [jcheck](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jcheck/)

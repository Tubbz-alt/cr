 22 There are also CLI tools available for importing OpenJDK
 23 [Mercurial](https://mercurial-scm.org/) repositories into
 24 [Git](https://git-scm.com/) repositories and vice versa:
 25 
 26 - git-openjdk-import
 27 - git-verify-import
 28 - hg-openjdk-import
 29 
 30 The following server-side tools (so called &quot;bots&quot;) for interacting with
 31 external Git source code hosting providers are available:
 32 
 33 - hgbridge - continuously convert Mercurial repositories to git
 34 - mlbridge - bridge messages between mailing lists and pull requests
 35 - notify - send email notifications when repositories are updated
 36 - pr - add OpenJDK workflow support for pull requests
 37 - submit - example pull request test runner

 39 ## Building
 40 
 41 [JDK 12](http://jdk.java.net/12/) or later and [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)
<span class="line-modified"> 42 5.2.1 or later is required for building. To build the project on macOS or</span>
<span class="line-modified"> 43 GNU/Linux, just run the following command from the source tree root:</span>
 44 
 45 ```bash
 46 $ sh gradlew
 47 ```
 48 
<span class="line-modified"> 49 To build the project on Windows, run the following command from the source tree root:</span>
 50 
 51 ```bat
 52 &gt; gradlew
 53 ```
 54 
 55 The extracted jlinked image will end up in the `build` directory in the source
 56 tree root.

 58 It is also supported to cross-jlink jimages to GNU/Linux, macOS and/or Windows from
 59 any of the aforementioned operating systems. To build all applicable jimages
 60 (including the server-side tooling), run the following command from the
 61 source tree root:
 62 
 63 ```bash
 64 sh gradlew images
 65 ```

 67 ## Installing
 68 
 69 To install the Skara tools, include the `skara.gitconfig` Git configuration
 70 file in your user-level Git configuration file. On macOS or
 71 GNU/Linux:
 72 
 73 ```bash
 74 $ git config --global include.path &quot;$PWD/skara.gitconfig&quot;

<span class="line-added"> 60 If you want to build on an operating system other than GNU/Linux, macOS or</span>
<span class="line-added"> 61 Windows _or_ if you want to build on a CPU architecture other than x64, then</span>
<span class="line-added"> 62 ensure that you have JDK 12 or later installed locally. You can then run the</span>

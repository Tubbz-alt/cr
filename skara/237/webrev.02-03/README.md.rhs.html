<pre>  1 # OpenJDK Project Skara
  2 
  3 The goal of Project Skara is to investigate alternative SCM and code review
  4 options for the OpenJDK source code, including options based upon Git rather than
  5 Mercurial, and including options hosted by third parties.
  6 
  7 This repository contains tooling for working with OpenJDK projects and
  8 their repositories. The following CLI tools are available as part of this
  9 repository:
 10 
 11 - git-jcheck - a backwards compatible Git port of [jcheck](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jcheck/)
 12 - git-webrev - a backwards compatible Git port of [webrev](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/webrev/)
 13 - git-defpath - a backwards compatible Git port of [defpath](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/defpath/)
 14 - git-fork - fork a project on an external Git source code hosting provider to your personal space and optionally clone it
 15 - git-pr - interact with pull requests for a project on an external Git source code hosting provider
 16 - git-info - show OpenJDK information about commits, e.g. issue links, authors, contributors, etc.
 17 - git-token - interact with a Git credential manager for handling personal access tokens
 18 - git-translate - translate between [Mercurial](https://mercurial-scm.org/)
 19 and [Git](https://git-scm.com/) hashes
 20 - git-skara - learn about and update the Skara CLI tools
 21 
 22 There are also CLI tools available for importing OpenJDK
 23 [Mercurial](https://mercurial-scm.org/) repositories into
 24 [Git](https://git-scm.com/) repositories and vice versa:
 25 
 26 - git-openjdk-import
 27 - git-verify-import
 28 - hg-openjdk-import
 29 
 30 The following server-side tools (so called &quot;bots&quot;) for interacting with
 31 external Git source code hosting providers are available:
 32 
 33 - hgbridge - continuously convert Mercurial repositories to git
 34 - mlbridge - bridge messages between mailing lists and pull requests
 35 - notify - send email notifications when repositories are updated
 36 - pr - add OpenJDK workflow support for pull requests
 37 - submit - example pull request test runner
 38 
 39 ## Building
 40 
 41 [JDK 12](http://jdk.java.net/12/) or later and [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)
 42 5.6.2 or later is required for building. To build the project on macOS or
 43 GNU/Linux x64, just run the following command from the source tree root:
 44 
 45 ```bash
 46 $ sh gradlew
 47 ```
 48 
 49 To build the project on Windows x64, run the following command from the source tree root:
 50 
 51 ```bat
 52 &gt; gradlew
 53 ```
 54 
 55 The extracted jlinked image will end up in the `build` directory in the source
 56 tree root.
 57 
 58 ### Other operating systems and CPU architectures
 59 
 60 If you want to build on an operating system other than GNU/Linux, macOS or
 61 Windows _or_ if you want to build on a CPU architecture other than x64, then
 62 ensure that you have JDK 12 or later installed locally. You can then run the
 63 following command from the source tree root:
 64 
 65 ```bash
 66 $ sh gradlew
 67 ```
 68 
 69 The extracted jlinked image will end up in the `build` directory in the source
 70 tree root.
 71 
 72 ### Offline builds
 73 
 74 If you don&#39;t want the build to automatically download any dependencies, then
 75 you must ensure that you have installed the following software locally:
 76 
 77 - JDK 12 or later
 78 - Gradle 5.6.2 or later
 79 
<a name="1" id="anc1"></a><span class="line-modified"> 80 To create a build then run the command:</span>
 81 
 82 ```bash
 83 $ gradle offline
 84 ```
 85 
 86 _Please note_ that the above command does _not_ make use of `gradlew` to avoid
 87 downloading Gradle.
 88 
 89 The extracted jlinked image will end up in the `build` directory in the source
 90 tree root.
 91 
 92 ### Cross-linking
 93 
 94 It is also supported to cross-jlink jimages to GNU/Linux, macOS and/or Windows from
 95 any of the aforementioned operating systems. To build all applicable jimages
 96 (including the server-side tooling), run the following command from the
 97 source tree root:
 98 
 99 ```bash
100 sh gradlew images
101 ```
102 
103 ## Installing
104 
105 To install the Skara tools, include the `skara.gitconfig` Git configuration
106 file in your user-level Git configuration file. On macOS or
107 GNU/Linux:
108 
109 ```bash
110 $ git config --global include.path &quot;$PWD/skara.gitconfig&quot;
111 ```
112 
113 On Windows:
114 
115 ```bat
116 &gt; git config --global include.path &quot;%CD%/skara.gitconfig&quot;
117 ```
118 
119 To check that everything works as expected, run the command `git skara help`.
120 
121 ## Testing
122 
123 [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/) 5.5.1 or later is required to run the unit
124 tests. To run the tests, execute following command from the source tree root:
125 
126 ```bash
127 $ sh gradlew test
128 ```
129 
130 The tests expect [Git](https://git-scm.com/) version 2.19.1 or later and
131 [Mercurial](https://mercurial-scm.org/) 4.7.1 or later to be installed on
132 your system.
133 
134 This repository also contains a Dockerfile, `test.dockerfile`, that allows
135 for running the tests in a reproducible way with the proper dependencies
136 configured. To run the tests in this way, run the following command from the
137 source tree root:
138 
139 ```bash
140 $ sh gradlew reproduce
141 ```
